<p class="dc l1"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Second Division under
General Lawton swarmed up the
fire-swept hill of El Caney,
through an unremitting storm of
bullets, Colonel Arthur Lee, of
the British Royal Artillery, exclaimed,
“I would not have believed
it!”</p>

<p>Two years later, when Lord
Roberts’s army of ragged khaki
poured into Pretoria after their
two thousand miles’ march from
the Cape, Captain Slocum, of the
United States Infantry, said,
“Tommy Atkins is certainly a
wonder.”</p>

<p>There is obvious reason for a detailed comparison
between the fighting men of the United States
and Great Britain. They have more in common
than either army has with the soldiers of any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
nation. They have both during the last three years
fought testing wars against other civilized nations,
in which they faced for the first time the new conditions
of modern warfare. The relative qualifications
of the two armies have a pressing bearing
on the troublous questions of alliance or disputes
yet to be between them. When the soldiers of
these two nations meet now, each has a sense of
their peculiar relation of mutuality, which is made
piquant by the uncertainty whether they will continue
to support one another, as in China, or
whether there is an evil day in store when they
shall have to cut one another’s throats. But whatever
the uncertainty, and whatever the surface criticisms
which each passes upon the other, there is at
bottom both respect and fraternity on the part of
each.</p>

<p>The American soldier to-day occupies a new place
in the regard of the world. Up to the campaigning
of July and August, 1898, in Cuba, Porto Rico,
and Luzon, the military men of Europe were accustomed
to think of the fighting force of the United
States as a thing too small to be considered. They
had forgotten the great Civil War, and they did not
comprehend our vast resources for a volunteer army.
A standing army of 25,000 men was insignificant to
officers and statesmen who were accustomed to estimate
a national force in the terms of millions. Consequently,
the martial potency of the United States
had fallen into general contempt. This judgment,
however, was wholly changed in the space of a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
months, and instead of considering our military
force on a level with that of some little South
American republic, Europe suddenly comprehended
that there was a new military power in the world
which had not been taken into account. From the
time that over two million men responded to the
President’s call for 200,000 volunteers—many of
them fairly trained soldiers, and nearly all of them
skilled in the use of firearms—the sentiment of
Europe was changed.</p>

  <div class="caption">Captain Slocum, U.S.A.,

<p>There was a more radical change in the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
sentiment of England than anywhere else. At the
beginning of the Spanish-American War one London
paper said, “Now we will see the boastful
Yankee go down before the fighting Spaniard.”
The general tone of the English press, if not directly
hostile, was not friendly. But a few exhibitions
of American arms changed the opinion to
such a marked degree that soon there was hardly a
hostile paper in all England. This popular reaction
in favor of America is not, however, to be confused
with the attitude of the British Government, which
had been friendly from the start, and which had
done our cause inestimable benefit through its forcible
“hands off!” communication to other European
powers. Nevertheless, this friendly disposition
of the British Ministry was confirmed by its
perception of the increasing prestige of the American
military force both in England and on the
Continent.</p>

<p>But if the American soldier seems only recently
to have come to his own in the appreciation of
Europe, he has long been the same soldier that he
is to-day. To be sure, training and discipline have
improved him as a product; our officers have made
the study of the soldier a science, and each year
has marked a finer adaptation of methods to ends;
Yankee ingenuity has had fewer traditional prejudices
to overcome than have prevailed abroad, and
in the relations of officers and men, in the development
of each unit’s individuality as a self-reliant intelligence,
the later years have been a period of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
surprising evolution. But, on the other hand, the
American soldier’s native quality is the same as in
that Civil War which required four years of more
terrible slaughter than Europe ever knew before
one side would yield to the other. If we were
always confident of him, our boasts were founded
on an experience of his fibre which Europe had not
apprehended. His valor, his quiet contempt of
death, could not, in its most extreme exhibition,
surprise his own countrymen. The only thing that
robbed the gallant Hobson and his comrades of the
highest distinction was that several thousand others
on the fleet were sick with disappointment that they
could not go in their place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the appreciation of Europe is agreeable,
if belated.</p>

<p>The soldier of the Queen did not need a new
opportunity to prove his quality. From the time
that Cromwell’s Ironsides made the chivalry of the
Continent to skip, Europe and America have had a
steadfast respect for the redoubtability of the British
warrior. Moreover, he has been a civilizing
power throughout the world; wherever he has
cleared a path, commerce has followed. It has not
always seemed like Christian justice to hew a way
for trade with a sword, or to subject an unwilling
people to a rule of might under which they chafe
and fret; but there is always one word of praise
which can truthfully be said—the government that
reaches from London to the remotest quarters of
the globe has made the world better, happier, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
securer, even through its conquests over unwilling
peoples. Redcoat and khaki have stood for order,
and, in the main and in the long run, for the largest
justice to the largest number.</p>

<p>The time-honored phrase about the flag and trade
is true. But few pause to consider the cost that is
paid by the men of the empire who carry the flag
forward that trade may follow. When the Queen
issued the proclamation of war against the two republics
nestled in the heart of South Africa, the
world looked on and pitied the little States, and
averred that such a war could not last more than a
few weeks; but President Krüger said, “If England
plants her flag on this land she will pay a price
in blood that will stagger humanity.” She has paid
that price for more than a year, and the payment is
not yet complete. Never before has she paid such
cost in the blood of her own sons. This is not
the place to discuss the right and wrong of that
struggle. Spite of all protests, it became a ghastly
fact of history; from apparently impregnable kopjes,
and their hillsides that were shambles, the determined
English soldiers drive the unawed burghers
over the vast veldts, fighting literally from rock to
rock.</p>

  <div class="caption">British soldiers visiting the U. S. troop-ship Sumner,

<p>It was my opportunity to be with both the Boer
and British armies in South Africa, and to observe
the fighting qualities of the men on both sides.
After the Boers evacuated Pretoria, and I remained
to witness the British operations, I came to agree
with Captain Slocum that “Tommy Atkins is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
wonder.” He certainly is. During two years
spent in Europe I saw the great manœuvres on
Salisbury Plain and at Aldershot; I have seen the
British soldier on foreign garrison service and in
the field; and, last, I have seen him in Africa, confronted
by new problems and fighting against modern
weapons in the hands of thinking men. From
the point of view of this experience I venture to
draw certain comparisons and contrasts between
him and the American soldier, whose fighting steps
I have followed in half a dozen campaigns, against
the Indians in the West and also in the war with
Spain.</p>

<p>The system of “crack” regiments in the British
army has done much to injure the service of that
country, as it has developed the “spit and polish”
officer, as he is called in London—an imposing
society soldier, useless in war. The men of these
regiments are the pick of the nation, but unless there
is an exceptional campaign they are not sent out.
The Guards are usually ordered to the front long
enough to get their medals, and then are sent home.
During the last Soudan campaign the battalion of
Guards was away from England only a few weeks,
and were, as the late war correspondent, G. W.
Steevens, said, “packed in ice, shipped to the front,
and then shipped back.” During the Boer War
the Guards have not had such an easy time, as it
was necessary to use the whole army in active
operations; and they have proved themselves good
fighters when properly officered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
There is one exception to the rule of pampering
the “crack” regiments in the case of the Gordon
Highlanders, for they have seen the hardest service
of every campaign since the organization of the
regiment. Their glory is in fighting rather than
in polo and cricket, in campaigning rather than in
dancing.</p>

<p>The sturdy, practical soldiers have a large contempt
for the youngster of birth who has received
his commission through favoritism, and they never
lose an opportunity of expressing it. While in
Pretoria after the British occupation, I installed
myself in one of the best houses in the city, having
commandeered it when the owner, who was a British
subject, fled. To make my position more secure
I hung out a small American flag, so that I should
not be disturbed. When the British entered the
capital, General French’s cavalry division occupied
the portion of the town in which my borrowed
home stood, and I invited two or three of the
officers of his staff to share the house with me.
Some days after their acceptance an order was
issued by the military governor to seize all horses
in Pretoria, and a battalion of Guards was detailed
to form a line across the city, making a clean sweep
of every horse not already in governmental possession.
I rode up to my door just as the line struck
that vicinity, and the soldiers were leading out some
of the horses belonging to the cavalry staff officers
living with me. Lieutenant-Colonel Welsh, a thorough
soldier, who has learned his profession by hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
campaigning, was at the moment expostulating with
a stupid officer of the Guards, who was just remarking,
“Beastly business, this horse-stealing, but—aw—I
have to do it, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t have my horse,” exclaimed
Colonel Welsh, with an emphasis that told the
Guardsman he was some one of importance.</p>

<p>That officer screwed his glass into his eye, looked
about, and seeing the American flag, turned to
Colonel Welsh, who was in full uniform, and said,
“Oh, I say—are you the American consul fellow?”</p>

<p>This was too much for the old soldier, who fairly
exploded in his indignation; but his pity for the
poor Londoner prompted him to explain, with an
amusing manner, that he had the honor of holding
the Queen’s commission, and that foreign consuls
were not in the habit of wearing the British uniform.</p>

<p>When the Ninth Infantry marched into Santiago
to act as a guard of honor to General Shafter, and
to participate in the raising of the flag over the palace,
a Spanish officer standing by me on the cathedral
steps asked if this was one of our “crack”
regiments. I told him it was not, and he looked
rather surprised.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you have any more like
this, do you?” he inquired.</p>

<div id="i_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="366" height="240" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">British officers at Malta, watching the setting-up
exercises of American soldiers.</div></div>

<p>“Why, they are all the same out there in the
trenches,” I replied; but he evidently did not believe
me, and then I realized that here was a regiment
of men the like of whom the Spaniards had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
never seen, its smallest man taller than their tallest,
its horses half a foot taller than theirs, and I ceased
to wonder that he thought it a “crack” regiment.
The army of the United States, when the Spanish
War broke out, was superlative in its personnel.
The hard times of a few years before had led hosts
of men of exceptionally high grade to apply for enlistment,
and of these fine applicants not more than
one in ten had been taken; each regiment was a
sifted remainder. But in our army it is the rule
that if there is one regiment more “crack” than
another, that is the one to have the honor of the
hardest service.</p>

<p>In the use of government funds in the field the
British army has a great advantage over our own
force, for their officers are allowed much more freedom
in expenditures for campaigning purposes. It
is true that they use much more money in consequence,
but in many cases it is essential that an
army should have that freedom from red tape which
is enjoyed by the British.</p>

<p>In South Africa every officer who has any occasion
to use money is provided with a government
check-book; when he wishes to buy stock, provisions,
or forage he appraises the value himself and
gives a check for the amount, or sometimes pays in
gold on the spot. The British army, in consequence,
pays the top price for everything; but, as they wish
to conciliate the people as much as possible, it is
a very good policy.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when an American officer wishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
to buy anything for the government, he is obliged
to have its value decided upon by a board, and
then the payment is made through the tortuous
channels of the paymaster’s department. Innumerable
vouchers, receipts, affidavits, and money
orders pass back and forth before the party who is
selling receives the amount due him.</p>

<p>The right system is a mean between these two
extremes; for the English method is as much too
loose as ours is too stringent. The British government
pays for its method every month thousands
of pounds more than necessary. I watched a remount
officer buy horses in Pretoria, and the prices
he paid were staggering. The animals had been
seized by the government troops, but payment was
made to any one who came to the public square
and laid claim to a horse. The officer in charge of
the work happened to be an exceedingly good-natured
and agreeable fellow, who said the people
undoubtedly needed the money. He asked each
person presenting a claim what he thought his animal
worth, and almost invariably paid the full sum
demanded, without a word of protest. He paid as
high as £60 for animals not worth a third of that
amount. It can well be imagined that the stock
left in any of the towns by the burghers when they
evacuated was not of a very high order, as they all
went away mounted in the best possible style, and
in many cases leading an extra horse. Every man
in the Boer army is mounted, and well mounted,
on native stock, that does not need to be fed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
grain to be kept in good condition, as the veldt
grass on which these horses live and thrive is similar
to our prairie grass.</p>

<p>The equipment of the British army can in no way
compare with that of the American soldiers; it is
heavier, badly slung, and is far less useful. In the
first place, the saddle used by both the cavalry and
mounted infantry is almost double the weight of
the McClellan pattern used by our army. The
mounted infantry saddle is the flat seat known in
this country as an “English saddle,” one which
should be used only in the park or in racing. As it
has no raised back it affords no rest to a man while
on long rides. The cavalry saddle, especially that
of the Lancers, has a slightly higher back and is
somewhat easier; nevertheless, it is much too flat
according to the American idea. The manner in
which the mounted infantrymen ride is enough to
show that the saddle is a very bad one for use in
the field, for the rider has no command over his
mount and no security of his seat; he keeps it
merely on the sufferance of a good-natured horse.</p>

<p>The Canadian troops in South Africa created
much comment because of their saddles, for the
eastern contingent had the United States army
McClellan saddle, and the western force rode the
regular Montana “cowboy saddle.” About two
thousand McClellan saddles had been condemned
by our government inspectors on account of being
a fraction of an inch too narrow across the withers;
and the Canadian government, needing some uniform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
saddle in a great hurry, bought them. They
were quite satisfactory for the Canadians, for their
horses are smaller than the American animals, and
the slight defect in construction made no difference.
Henceforth, the McClellan saddle will be known as
the “Canadian saddle” in England.</p>

<p>The Boers equipped themselves fully in saddles,
bridles, blankets, and all other horse equipment
from the stock they captured. There was not a saddle
to be seen that did not come from the English
ordnance stores, although in many cases the rider
cut off all the extra flaps and threw away the heavy
bags and pouches, which encumber the horse and
are of no use.</p>

<p>The cavalry equipment of the American army
weighs a total of ninety-eight pounds, including
carbine and sabre; while that of the English service
is at least fifty or sixty pounds more. There is one
thing, however, in which their outfit is superior to
ours—their saddles are built of fair leather. A
black saddle is much harder to keep in good condition,
and does not continue to look well nearly so
long after it has been cleaned as does the brown
leather. Our ordnance department is experimenting
with fair leather equipments, and many have
already been issued. Our cavalrymen hope that
soon there will be no black saddles left in service.</p>

<p>The British infantry equipment is unpractical to
an amazing degree; it is heavy and cumbersome, and
includes accouterments that are needless. There is
a heavy set of straps and cross-belts, suggesting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
harness of a dray-horse, and all that this antique
framework is useful for is to hold up the blanket,
cartridge-box, and bayonet scabbard. The cartridge-boxes
are as heavy as the cartridges themselves.
I had a full kit such as is used in the
American army, which I displayed one day to an
officer of General French’s staff. He remarked:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we shall have that some day. In about
thirty years, when you have invented something
much better, our War Office will adopt something
like this.”</p>

<p>Wide admiration was expressed for my American
rubber poncho blanket with its hole for the head,
which adapts it for use as a coat, for the British
have nothing like that. I saw the poor Tommies
sleeping out, night after night, in a cold, pouring
rain, with nothing over them but a woolen blanket.
They have no field protection like our shelter tent
to shield them from the weather, and it is surprising
that there has been so little fever.</p>

<p>Our knapsack, also, is greatly superior to the
British haversack bag, which must be carried in the
hand when the troops are changing quarters or are
embarking for a voyage. The knapsack is a light
trunk, which will hold everything that a man needs
for many weeks.</p>

back, the back visor strikes the shoulders and the
helmet falls off. The soldier cannot keep it on
his head when he is sleeping; he might as well go
to war in an opera-hat. The felt field-hat has been
adopted by nearly all the colonials and by some of
the volunteers from England; and although the
English have a difficult task to overcome the tradition
attached to anything that has become a part of
the service, and although the helmet gives the men
a uniform and very military appearance, its eventual
disappearance is inevitable.</p>

<p>There was a time when we learned much from
England regarding military affairs, but that period
has passed, and it would be to her conspicuous advantage
to copy our excellent field equipment, as
well as several other things.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I fully share the sentiment
which reproaches the British government for the
continued use of “dum-dum” bullets. At the
Peace Conference at The Hague it will be remembered
that the British representatives maintained
the privilege of shooting with these bullets when
the War Office so chose, against the protest of the
other powers; and the Americans in this dispute
stood with the British. Terrible as is their wound
as compared with the neat, needle-like thrust of the
Mauser bullet, for instance, in the long run they
are the more merciful.</p>

<p>In South Africa both sides used these tearing
projectiles to some extent, although they were not
supposed to be issued. I saw some British prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
brought into Pretoria who had a lot of “Mark
IV” ammunition, which is the deadliest “dum-dum”
made. The steel jacket of the bullet is split
at the sides and at the nose, and when it strikes a
body, these sides of the jacket curl outward with
a ghastly result. It was afterwards stated by the
British authorities that this “Mark IV” ammunition
had been issued at Natal by mistake, as the
British contest had always been that these bullets
were intended solely for those savage foes who did
not mind perforation with the clean little modern
bullet.</p>

<p>The Boers, on their side, had considerable ammunition
known as the “blue-nose bullet.” This
projectile has no jacket at all over its leaden nose,
which spreads out like a mushroom on reaching its
target. The use of this was also the result of a mistake
in issuance; it had been bought by the Transvaal
government long before war was thought of,
and was intended for sporting use, since the regular
steel-jacket bullet would not stop big game. But,
on the other hand, in many instances the burghers
turned their regular jacket bullets into “dum-dums”
by simply scraping off the steel at the nose,
leaving the lead to flatten as it struck; when they
had no file for this, they rubbed them against a
rock.</p>

<p>The humane theory of the small calibre steel bullet
is that when it strikes, unless it hits a vital spot,
it does not mangle, but simply puts a man out of
action, and that two more men take him to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
rear, thus putting three out of action. But the
theory does not work; for now that the magazine
gun has multiplied every man in the trenches ten
or twenty fold, no erect man of the attacking force
can be spared to care for wounded comrades; consequently
the man who falls is left where he is; no
one can pay the slightest attention to him when
every minute is infinitely precious and every stalking
man is needed for the final instant. On the
other hand, many of the wounds thus made are so
slight that, if promptly cared for after the battle,
the wounded men are able in a few days to be back
with their regiments.</p>

<p>The little bullet darts through the soft part of leg
or arm or body like a sewing-machine needle, and if
a vital spot is not struck, and if no bones are shattered,
the flesh closes up with beautiful repair; and
if antisepticized the recovery is surprisingly quick.
The prompt reappearance of these many slightly
wounded men on the firing line is equivalent to a
perpetual reënforcement; thus the campaign is prolonged
indefinitely.</p>

<p>The humane sentiment is neutral as to the victory
of either side in wars between civilized armies, and
prays only that the slaughter and destruction may
cease as soon as possible. If in the early weeks of
the South African struggle each man hit had been
wholly disabled, if not killed outright, it is inconceivable
that the British people would have permitted
the war to go on. If in the Philippines each
native struck by an American bullet had been unable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
to recover and soon appear in arms again, that
unhappy struggle would have ended long ago.
Consequently, there is much to be considered before
making a wholesale condemnation of the
“dum-dum.” War cannot be anything but the
most infernal thing on earth, and the sooner a campaign
is over the better. We have to remind ourselves
of the language of one of the generals in the
Civil War to his officers: “Gentlemen, war means
fight, and fight means kill; therefore the more you
kill in any battle the sooner the misery of the war
will end.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">The</span> British soldier as he appears
in the streets of London
is the finest thing to
look at in the military world.
Although to the unused American
eye most of these beings
seem to be a little theatric in
appearance, they are all that
could be desired in uniform,
build, and military bearing.
In a nation of big men they
have been chosen primarily
for their height and their
chest measurement, and they
can scarcely be criticised for
the somewhat exaggerated
jauntiness which betrays a
consciousness of their superior
looks.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the
American soldier as he is
seen in the streets of a garrison city is not marked
by either self-consciousness or noticeable bigness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
His uniform is not showy, although it fits well, and
the man inside of it is well set up; he is wiry, spry,
and although of soldierly bearing, is more to be
remarked for his alertness of movement. You would
never think of calling him a magnificent creature;
the keen face under the visored cap might be that
of a young mechanic, business man, or student who
had learned how to wear a uniform easily.</p>

<p>The recruit of the British army is chosen on physical
grounds, and his obvious proportions seem to
have been particularly desired. The American soldier,
as we see him, talk with him, and hear what
his officers have to say of him, seems to have obtained
his place because he is a good all-around
man, with no more muscle than intelligence, and
with soundness of teeth considered as important as
extensiveness of height.</p>

<p>The recruiting of the British army is admirably
managed by some of the cleverest sergeants in the
service. They must be able to tell at a glance
whether an applicant is likely to pass an examination,
and then they must paint the glories and possibilities
of a soldier’s life in sufficiently alluring
colors to persuade the prospective recruit to accept
the “King’s shilling.”</p>

<p>The recruiting of the British army is always an
interesting feature of the military life of London,
and one may see it any week-day morning under
the walls of the gallery opposite the church of
St.-Martin’s-in-the-Fields. This church is on the upper
edge of Trafalgar Square, in the busiest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
city, and from nine o’clock in the morning the work
goes on all day. The various branches of the service
place signboards on the fence of the gallery
court, upon which are hung bills that set forth in
glowing language the advantages to be gained by
enlisting in this or that service; also stating the requirements,
pay, and allowances. All these boards
are hung side by side, and there is an unwritten
law that should a man be reading or looking at one
board, the sergeant representing another branch of
the service, or another regiment, is not permitted to
speak to him until he has passed on. As soon as
he has left the board, any of the recruiting officers
is at liberty to speak to him.</p>

<p>There are from ten to twenty non-commissioned
officers on duty at this place every morning; they
are the finest types of men in the British service,
and always appear in their best uniforms. They
nearly all have the rank of sergeant-major, consequently
their uniforms glitter with gold lace and
attract the youth who have an eye for the military.
One old sergeant-major is a particularly conspicuous
character, being a veteran of the Crimea. He
is a very old man, has been seen at this same spot,
on the same service, for many years, and has become
as well known to the Londoner as the very buildings
themselves. His hair and beard are snow-white,
and the years of campaigning have left their
mark on his face; but his step is as youthful and
elastic as that of any of the younger men on the
same duty, and on his breast are the medals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
many wars, most of them being ribbons one never
sees except at Chelsea. He is the most energetic
man on the recruiting detail, and he very seldom
makes an error as to the eligibility of an applicant.</p>

  <div class="caption">Persuasion by sergeant-major.</div></div>

<p>All day long the passers-by are scanned by these
sharp old soldiers, and are invited to join the forces
of the empire and attain the glory that, according
to the “sar’-major,” is sure to be his portion. The
dignity with which the recruiting is done is very
pleasing, for these officers, uncommissioned though
they be, wear their uniforms with the grace of a
major-general. When they approach a man, they
do so with an air of authority, in a straightforward
manner, and although they depict the attractions
of the service beguilingly, they seldom attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
gain a recruit against his will. Most of those who
loiter about the boards come with their minds made
up to enlist, and do not need any great amount of
persuasion. The grade of recruits taken in this
manner is said to be rather low, as they are generally
of the class that does not like to work, and has
a mistaken idea that a soldier has an easy life.</p>

<p>Another method of recruiting the British army
is by “recruiting marches” through the rural districts.
With their most attractive uniforms, colors
flying, and music piping, a battalion makes the
entry into a town on their march in such engaging
style that many of the youths of the place are sure
to cast their lot with the army on the impulse of
the moment; and in this way some of the best men
are found, as in Great Britain the country lad seems
to make the best soldier.</p>

<p>In the United States it has not been found necessary
to resort to these expedients to gain recruits.
The recruiting offices in time of peace show a small
but steady stream of callers; they are not from the
degraded classes, nor are they ignorant men; they
are young men of various social grades who, in
many cases, have been advised by older men to
enter the army, or who think they see in its discipline,
regularity of life, and opportunity for promotion
a promising opening for three years of
trial.</p>

<p>The rigidity of the examinations is in itself an
attraction to the young American. There is no
other line of work for which he must submit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
such searching competitive tests as he finds in the
recruiting office. Physically he must be perfect;
unsoundness of eye, ear, lung, heart, liver, skin,
limbs, extremities, or any other defect, will debar
him no less than would his inability to read and
write.</p>

<p>There is also in the United States a continual
fostering of the military spirit among the youth by
means of the cadet corps in the public and private
schools. Again, the fact that so many boys in
America are taught to ride and shoot has its natural
influence in leading large numbers of them to think
of the army. The patriotic instruction and the
devotion to the flag which are now so prominent a
feature in the public schools, have also an influence
in turning the minds of many young men to the
national service.</p>

<p>Two exceedingly strong attractions which the
American army presents, and which are lacking in
the British army, are the inducements of good pay
and of promotion. The English recruit enlists for
a period of twelve years, without the opportunity
of ever becoming more than a non-commissioned
officer, and for the sum of twenty-four cents a day;
while the American enlists for three years, with the
possibility of becoming lieutenant-general commanding
the army, and for pay which, including
ration and clothing allowance, a portion of which
thrifty men can commute into cash, amounts to at
least one dollar a day, and from that up to three
dollars and a half a day, together with twenty per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
cent. increase on all pay for active service. The
American government provides that the paymaster
shall take charge of any funds that the men do not
wish to draw, and it pays a high rate of interest on
these deposits. Thus, large numbers of our men
have saved several thousand dollars out of their pay,
and yet have lived well and had money to spend all
the time.</p>

<p>The chief spur, however, that acts on the enlisted
man in the army of the United States is not the
money, but the possibility that some day he may
become an officer. To commission an officer from
the ranks in the British army is almost unheard of;
while, on the contrary, a large number of the American
non-commissioned officers and men receive their
straps every year. The one thing that I could
never make an English officer understand was that
it is possible for our government to commission
men from the ranks. They could appreciate how
these men might be fully qualified as to their military
knowledge, but they could not comprehend
how it would be possible for the West Pointer to
associate with them or to meet them on an equal
footing in society. They could not understand
that many of the men in the ranks are in the same
station in life as are the West Point graduates.
That social possibility is the result of different conditions.
Many officers’ sons who wish to follow in
the footsteps of their fathers are not fortunate
enough to obtain an appointment to the Academy;
these boys always enlist, and, to the credit of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
government, they rarely fail to get a commission if
they can qualify in the examinations.</p>

  <img src="images/i_045b.jpg" width="325" height="133" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">British recruits at bayonet practice.</div></div>

<p>Moreover, the breeding as well as the intelligence
of many of the men accepted for enlistment
is of the same kind that is required of the applicants
at West Point. In an army where every recruit
must be able at least to read and write, it is
impossible to find, even among the colored troops,
any of that low-bred class of men which exists in
large numbers in the British army. Before the war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
with Spain, when the army was on a peace footing,
there were about five applicants for every vacancy;
consequently the recruiting officer could choose
with care, and an exceptionally high class of men
entered the regular army.</p>

<p>It is a rare circumstance that puts a gentle-born
Englishman into the ranks, and the discredit he
suffers for enlisting is deep indeed; for soldiers and
servants in England stand on the same footing. In
the continental nations of Europe soldiering, while
it is disliked, is considered as a matter of course,
because it is compulsory upon all men to serve.
But in England, where the service is voluntary, the
private rank is not a nice place for the upper classes.</p>

<p>In New York, in Boston, in Chicago, it is not impossible
to see the private’s blouse at a tea function
or across the table at dinner, in the most refined
society; after the instant’s surprise at seeing the
insignia of the common soldier, it is remembered
that he is present in his own right, irrespective of
uniform, and he is admired for his unostentatious
service of the flag.</p>

<p>Once a charming Larchmont belle told me, with
the greatest pride, that she had a brother who was
a soldier, and she showed me his picture. There
were no straps on the shoulders, and the collar of
his blouse was turned down.</p>

<p>“He is a private in the Seventh Artillery,” she
said; “regulars, you know; and some day he will
be an officer.”</p>

<p>“Some day ... an officer” tells the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
story; it indicates one of the vital differences between
the British and the American soldier. When
the former enlists in the army, he knows he will
never get beyond a “non-com.;” while many of
those who cast in their lot with the United States
forces, do so with the anticipation that eventually
they may hold the President’s commission.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the South African War I met
a young Englishman in London who was bubbling
over with patriotic enthusiasm, and whose fixed
idea was to go to the war, and to go quickly before
it was over; but he told me that he had almost
given up all hope of getting there, as he had exhausted
every possible means of accomplishing his
desire. He had been to the War Office to see every
one, from Sir Evelyn Wood down; and although he
was a relative of the Duke of Devonshire, and
swung a great deal of influence, he could not make
it; and yet he said that he “simply <em>must</em> go.”</p>

<p>“If you really want to go so much, why do you
not enlist?” I asked.</p>

<p>“What! go as a Tommy?” he exclaimed;
“why, I could not do that.” And, as a matter of
fact, he could not, since the feeling against such a
course is so strong that even in time of war it would
not be countenanced by his social judges. I saw him
again in the later months of the war, and he had attained
his desire by going to the Cape on his own
responsibility and recruiting a troop of colonials,
afterwards receiving a commission to command it.</p>

<p>There are instances where men of social standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
have enlisted in the British army, but they are very
rare in comparison with those of the same class who
answered the President’s call to arms at the beginning
of the war with Spain; men who joined not
only the volunteer branches of the American army,
but who enlisted in large number as privates in the
regular service.</p>

<p>General Hector Macdonald is an interesting exception
in the British system. He rose from the
ranks, and is to-day one of the best officers of the
generals’ staff, and is loved, feared, and respected
by his men.</p>

<p>For these various reasons it is easy to see why
the personnel of the rank and file of the American
army is much higher than that of the British. This
is conspicuously true in the matter of mental attainments.
In our army it is rare to find a man who is
not fairly well educated, while the majority of the
men in the ranks are considerably enlightened.
There is not one illiterate man in the whole enlisted
force.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British army is dismally
low in its standard of literacy. In the official report
published in 1899, the illiterateness of the recruits
receives scathing comment; only forty-five in
one thousand were fairly educated; eighteen per
cent. were utterly illiterate.</p>

<p>The same attractions tend to secure for the
American army a larger proportion of healthy applicants
than apply for admission in the British
service. The official report which I have just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
quoted also states that thirty-five per cent. of all
applicants for enlistment in the British army have
to be rejected for physical disability.</p>

<p>In treating this subject before the United Service
Institution in London, in 1899, Colonel Douglas, of
the Royal service, described the recruits from the
north, or country districts, as “sallow, downcast,
nondescript youths, mostly artisans.” Regarding
the recruits in general, he said: “It is significant
that a good set of teeth is rare, except among the
agricultural recruits. The old recruiting sergeant
would have laughed at the recruits of to-day; the
army of the past had in it many blackguards, but
few degenerates. These are depressing conclusions,
but it must be remembered that this refers to our
peace army, which is recruited from the half-starved
offscourings of the streets. The physique of the
men who are offering themselves to-day, in time of
war, is very different from this. There are shoals
of Englishmen who cannot stand the drudgery and
discipline of the ranks in time of peace, but who
flock to the standard as soon as there is a chance of
fighting. The recruiting sergeants say that nearly
all of the material they are getting at present is of
a better class. These men want to fight for the
love of fighting, and not as a refuge from starvation.
A few weeks of training licks them into
shape. As long as the outbreak of war affords such
a stimulus to recruiting as this, there is no need to
despair of the British race.”</p>

<p>But as conditions now exist in both countries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
England has much more difficulty in filling her
ranks in time of peace than is encountered here.
Her army is vastly larger than ours, and its attractions
are vastly inferior. There is, accordingly, no
ground for surprise that both in mental attainments
and soundness of body the American recruit is measured
by a higher standard; and it is not strange
that the British government has such trouble in
persuading enough men to enter the ranks that
almost any sort of able-bodied man would be accepted.
Most of the field musicians of the British
regiments are mere boys, twelve to fifteen years of
age; these youth are enlisted regularly into the
army. The American forces employ grown men for
the same service, but the difficulty in obtaining men
makes such a force impossible in England.</p>

<p>Once a man has been enlisted, however, in the
British army, no pains are spared to make him as
good as the best of soldiers—not only in a physical
sense, but also in the training of his brains.</p>

<div id="i_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.5625em;">

<p>As soon as the British recruit is accepted he is
turned over to the drill sergeant, who proceeds to
make a soldier of him; and in all the world no better
man exists than the British drill sergeant for
the special line of duty of whipping recruits into
shape. He does nothing else, and consequently
becomes very proficient at his calling. These drill
masters are all alike; to see one is to see all. He
is a species of soldier by himself, and there is nothing
like him that I have ever seen. He does for
the British army the work that is done by the subaltern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
officer of the American army. He is by no
means gentle, but he is not unnecessarily severe,
as is the German or French drill master; he merely
understands his men better than any other master,
and consequently gets better results from them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
a shorter space of time. He takes a slouching
youth, of slovenly gait, from Whitechapel, and in
an incredibly short time turns him out into Hyde
Park a dashing young soldier, or sends him to the
Cape in khaki, as willing a fighter as can be found.</p>

<p>I have seen a German drill master strike a recruit
for some trifling mistake or inattention; I have
heard a Frenchman curse his squad by all the saints
in the calendar; but I know of nothing half so effective
as the quiet sarcasm that the English or Irish
drill sergeant can command when he is completely
out of patience with an awkward “rookie”; it is
more deadly than oaths or blows; it always accomplishes
the end. Up to the present, the British
army has been almost built, trained, and run by
non-commissioned officers, many of whom are superior
to the officers over them in all but birth and
breeding. These rankers are capable of commanding
in so far as capability depends upon understanding
every detail of their profession.</p>

<p>The majority of the English recruits are sent to
the great camp at Aldershot, which is a camp only
in name; for in reality it is a superb expanse of land,
covered with perfectly appointed barracks and well-laid
parades. At this training station the work of
the young soldier begins in earnest, and for the
better part of four months he is drilled, trained, and
instructed in all branches of soldiering. The most
interesting part of his work is that done in the gymnasium.
The average English recruit does not carry
himself in the manner of a soldier to the degree that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
an untrained American does, so that a more rigid
training than in the United States is necessary.
Moreover, the idea of the proper carriage of a soldier
is so vastly different in the two countries that
it is difficult to draw a comparison which will be
understood by one who is not familiar with both
armies. In the British army the old-time conventional
idea of soldierly appearance still dominates the
discipline; in the American army this idea is not absent,
and I hope it may never depart; but nevertheless,
the prevailing aim is to subordinate everything
to simple effectiveness. Broadly speaking, therefore,
one is tempted to say that the British soldier
is trained for show, while the American is trained
for comfort, for work, and for general usefulness.</p>

<p>The gymnasium at Aldershot is the best-equipped
establishment of its kind that I have ever seen;
there is nothing lacking that could add to the physical
training of the recruits sent there for their preliminary
teaching. For one hundred and ten days
each recruit has one hour a day devoted exclusively
to athletics, and in that time he is made to exercise
in walking, running, climbing, boxing, fencing, and
is instructed in the use of the bayonet. The men
scale high walls and clamber over lofty scaffolding at
double time; they go up and down swinging ladders
and hanging ropes.</p>

<p>The headquarters gymnasium is just outside of
the little town of Aldershot, among the miles of
barracks that quarter so many thousands of the
British army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
It is a large brick building, recently put up, and
contains every appliance known to athletic training,
most of the apparatus having been imported from
New York. The interior is bright and airy, handsomely
decorated with flags, stands of arms, and
trophies, making an attractive room in which to
work. Just at the left is a smaller building for instruction
in the use of the sabre and foil. Surrounding
the buildings are large fields for out-of-door
exercise, one side being a turf parade for
walking, running, jumping, and the many drills in
the use of the arms and legs. When the weather
permits, the classes in bayonet, single-stick, and
dumb-bells are taken to this field. On the other
side of the buildings are all sorts of stationary apparatus
similar to that inside; on that side also
there are walls to scale, heights to climb, besides
the ordinary bars and ladders. The best apparatus
that the recruits use is a great frame that looks as if
some one had started to build a house, and dropped
the work as soon as the scaffolding had been finished.
It is a square framework about fifty feet
high and forty feet wide; from it hang ropes, ladders,
poles, sliding-boards, and all kinds of devices
by which ascent and descent can be made. The
apparatus is of great value in training the eye as
well as the muscle, for the recruits are put over it
at double time, and the slightest false step would
mean a bad fall and broken bones. It was the invention
of Colonel the Hon. J. S. Napier, who has
been in command at the gymnasium for some time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and to whose efforts are due the perfection of the
system of training given, not only to the recruits,
but also to all officers and men who care to continue
their physical training.</p>

  <div class="caption">2. One of the exercises in British recruit-drill.</div></div>

<p>The most useful drill given to recruits is the use
of the “shelf.” This, as the name indicates, is a
huge shelf on the side of the gymnasium wall. It
is so high that a man cannot reach it as he stands
on the floor, and to mount it he must have the
assistance of one or more of his companions. The
aim of the shelf drill is to train the men to go over
walls and obstacles where there is nothing for them
to use in pulling themselves up. In working together,
one man makes a rest of his hands and gives
to his comrade a “boost”; then the man thus
assisted clambers up to the shelf, and turning, pulls
up the man below him.</p>

<p>The American recruit is handed over to a subaltern
officer, who is usually not long from West
Point, and is fresh with the athletic enthusiasm and
methods of the Academy. He takes the place of
the British drill sergeant. He tramps side by side
with the awkward recruit, and orders him to do
nothing which he himself is not able to do in a perfected
manner. This fact of itself establishes a
wholesome and trusting relation between the enlisted
man and his officer. The man looks up to
his superior as to an instructor and parent. He
learns to regard him not merely as his fugleman for
parades and campaigns, but also as his preceptor,
who knows him thoroughly and takes an interest in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
him. The motto of the American army is that the
officer is the father of his men.</p>

<p>The young recruit gains his first comprehension
of this as he is worked upon by his young superior
in shoulder-straps. No familiarity is permitted; the
etiquette is as rigid and unremitting as in any European
army; the orders are stiff and stern; and yet
the fact remains in the soldier’s mind, through his
entire service, that his officer labored patiently over
him for months, to impart to him from his own rich
store of self-command and high bearing, of physical
cleverness and military skill. The man never forgets
his place, nor his officer’s either.</p>

<p>The American recruit receives a thorough course
in all kinds of athletic drill, riding, fencing, walking,
running. Especial attention is given to the
“setting-up” exercises; these consist of a series of
movements of arms, legs, and body which involve
all the motions which are called for in any military
action. The turning of the arms, raising and lowering
them, propulsive motions, the limbering of the
joints—every movement that can contribute to
facility of action is a part of this extraordinary discipline.</p>

  <div class="caption">Recruit drill in the British army.</div></div>

<p>Beyond this, and of most practical moment, is
the American recruit’s training in making temporary
trenches with bayonet and tin plate; in seizing
and using temporary protections; in shooting from
behind trees, rocks, hillocks, while showing as little
of his body as possible. The consequence of this
drill is that when in battle the American soldier can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
manage himself without depending on orders, and
is an expert fighter.</p>

<p>In South Africa the British regulars could not be
asked to make even temporary entrenchments; they
had to wait for the engineer corps to come up and
lay them out and dig them. But a company of
American troops, with only the implements they
carry, can scrape up a pile of dirt in front of them
in less than five minutes sufficient to serve as their
fort in an all-day battle.</p>

<p>The charge by rushes which the British had to
learn on the battlefield is the trick which the
American recruit is taught before he leaves the
awkward squad. In this resourcefulness and practicality
the colonial troops in the South African
campaign were by many points superior to the British
regulars, and showed that they had been trained
to some extent by the same methods that have
been found so effective for the American recruit.</p>

<p class="dc l1 p2"><span class="smcap">There</span> is much in common
between the life of a tramp
and that of a soldier in campaign.
If the tramp had
ever watched an army on the
march it might not be difficult
for him to imagine himself
surrounded by all the
pomp of war. He is dirty,
unshaven, his clothes are
ragged and torn, and he
presents a generally dilapidated and loose-jointed
appearance. His line of march is along the railroad;
occasionally he gets a ride in a box car,
and at night he sleeps beside the track. If he is
lucky he gets a meal or so each day; he cooks the
meal himself over his own fire, the meat sizzling on
the end of a stick, and the coffee boiling in an old
can. On and on he marches along the railroad, he
does not know where, he does not care—he just
goes. Finally he comes to a town and stands
around in the switchyard, or at the station, until
some one comes along and orders him out. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
conditions are those of the life of the average tramp,
but they fit that of the soldier as well, the chief
point of difference being that the tramp does not
have to work and the soldier does.</p>

<p>Fighting is what the soldier longs for and lives
for; it does come sometimes, although infrequently;
and during the intervening routine of work he
almost forgets the fighting. The public at home
reads of battles, several of them perhaps occurring
within a week; but those actions cover the entire
theatre of the war, and consequently one command
may rarely see two fights in succession. There is
none of the glitter that the romancers depict; the
glory begins and ends with the triumphal march
through the streets to the transport. Up to the
time that the last line that connects with home is
cast off, and the great troop-ship turns her prow to
the land of the enemy, the soldier feels the true excitement
and exhilaration of war; the cheers of the
crowd along the line of march still ring in his ears;
the brave words of speeding that were spoken by
local officials, and the thoughtful attentions of the
ladies’ committees at the wharf are all bright memories
of the start towards fame and glory on the
battlefield. But about the time the jingling bell
in the engine-room tells the official at the throttle
that the ship is clear of the harbor, and that she
may settle down to her long voyage, the soldier begins
to realize that war is no romance, but a stern
reality that will take him away for a long time from
everything and everybody that he cares for, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the possibility that he may never come back at
all.</p>

<p>When he thinks of this, he pictures himself staggering
back from the crest of some hill that is to be
taken, with a rifle-ball in his heart. A few weeks
later the cause of his not going home means some
slow, consuming fever, or other wasting disease,
which gives him plenty of time to repent the day he
ever thought of going to war. Or instead of that
neat bullet through the heart, a ragged chunk of
shell rips off an arm or a leg, or tears its way
through his side, dropping him in the mud or dust,
to lie until some one finds time to pick him up, and
take him in a springless wagon to a crowded field
hospital, where a surgeon gives but hasty attention
to his needs. There is no “dying for the flag”
sentiment; no tender nurse, such as we see on the
stage, to take the last message home; instead, it is
a helpless sort of death, without any one near who
has time to give even a drink of water. There is no
resemblance that would come so near my idea of a soldier
killed in battle as that of an unclean, sweating,
and unshaven unfortunate of a crowded city, struck
by a street car, and thrown, bleeding and torn, into
the mud. Then, if no one had time to pick him
up, and he should lie there for hours, or perhaps
days, the picture of a soldier’s death would be complete.</p>

<p>After the first few weeks the whole idea of war
becomes a dread, and the one thought is, When
shall we go home? After a few months have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
passed, a helpless, “don’t care” feeling settles
over every one, and after that any change is highly
welcome, no matter whether it be home, the hospital,
or the trench. The tedium of war is more
telling upon the volunteer than upon the regular,
as the former soon begins to think of his interests
at home that are perhaps suffering. The volunteer
never thinks that his services will be needed more
than two or three months at the most; and when
the service drags well on toward a year, it becomes
almost unbearable. The regular does not mind it
so much, for his apprenticeship of worry has been
served with the early months of the first enlistment,
and any change from barrack life is an agreeable
one.</p>

  <img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="339" height="160" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Dangebhoy hospital cart used in South Africa.</div></div>

<p>After a soldier has been in the field for a few
months there is not much of the military appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
left to him except his gun, and there is not
the slightest trace of the smart, well-kept man on
home duty. It does not matter about his appearance,
however, for the man himself is there, and
of all sorts and conditions of men in all creation,
the true fighting man is the manliest. He works
day after day like a galley slave, endangers his life
night and day, and yet he is but the tiniest portion
of a great machine, of whom no one has ever heard,
and who will be forgotten before the ink is dry on
the treaty of peace. For a day he may be carried
on the shoulders of a victory-maddened crowd, and
compelled to drink rare wine from silver goblets;
nothing is then good enough for him—the victor.
But let him ask a favor from sovereign or subject,
from Congress or people, a year after, and no one
remembers him. His days and nights in the field,
suffering that the nation’s honor may live, are all
forgotten, and the fighting man is pushed to one
side to make room for the trade of peace that this
same man has made possible.</p>

<p>No honor is too great to render to the men who
go out to fight, whether they be regulars or volunteers.
The wage they receive would not pay any
man at home to undertake half so hazardous a task.
Within two years I have had the opportunity of
seeing the work of four different armies in the field,
fighting for what they thought was right. Among
those four—Spaniards, British, Boers, and Americans—can
be found a curious variety of methods of
warfare, and there is much that has never been told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
The common soldiers of every land are brave;
it is but a question of leaders, methods, and numbers
that decides which will be victorious; for losing
or winning, they show much the same valor. Nothing
could be more magnificent, nor reflect more
credit on the men of Spain, than the manner in
which they met defeat at El Caney, at Santiago, and
on the seas in the conflicts with Sampson and
Dewey. They went down in defeat in a way that
won the admiration of every soldier and sailor in
the American army and navy; they were brave,
dignified, and courteous at all times, even the rank
and file.</p>

<p>The fighting methods of the Boers and the Americans
are very similar, and if the Boers were trained
in military tactics their military character would be
almost identical with that of our troops. They possess
the same natural instinct of a hunter to keep
under cover that our men have, and their methods
during an advance are the same. The British army
has just taken its first lesson in this sort of work,
and although it has been a costly one, it will pay in
the end; and it is England’s great good fortune that
she did not have a powerful European foe for a
tutor, instead of the two little republics whose entire
male population would not make a good-sized
army corps.</p>

<p>At the autumn manœuvres of the British army at
Aldershot, just before the South African war broke
out, I was watching the attack and defense of a hill
by several battalions of infantry. Standing with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
me was an officer of the Twelfth Lancers, and we
watched the progress of the action with alert interest.
When the attacking force made its advance,
I noticed that neither the officers nor the men made
any attempt at keeping under the cover of the trees
or rocks which were numerous in the zone of fire.
Of course the men were using only blank ammunition,
but in the same work our men would be compelled
to crawl along from tree to tree, or to keep
under the shelter of the rocks. I remarked to my
companion that I should imagine the officers and
men would take greater interest in the work in hand
if they went at it as though it were real, and keeping
to cover.</p>

<p>“Why, you do not mean to say that American
officers and soldiers would hide behind rocks and
trees, do you?” he exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Of course they would,” I replied. “They
would not only get behind rocks and trees, but
behind the largest they could find. Don’t you do
the same?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” he said with emphasis, adding,
“What would the men think of an officer who
would hide during a fight?” As it was not my
first visit in England, I did not continue the argument.</p>

  <div class="caption">General French examining the enemy’s position during

<p>It was, indeed, the general British opinion that to
protect oneself in a fight was to hide, and with
this idea the men went to war in a country where
the enemy could find all the protection that he
wanted, and where he knew how to use it; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
so these brave soldiers were sent up in solid formation
to be shot to bits by an invisible foe. There
could be no greater test of the valor of the British
soldier than the manner in which he faced death
during the first months of the war.</p>

<p>The difference between the British and the American
soldier is very marked in the fact that the class
feeling in England is so great. All the middle and
lower classes of England are taught to touch their
hats to birth in what is called a gentleman, and no
matter where they meet one, they show him deference.
From these middle and lower classes the
army, of course, gathers its strength; consequently
there is a feeling of obedience even before the
real lesson of the soldier begins. This subservience
is not always a good thing, for any one who
has the appearance of a gentleman has about as
much influence or authority with the men as an
officer in uniform would have. An incident which
illustrates this occurred during the first days of the
British occupation of Pretoria. It was found that
some of the Boer sympathizers were communicating
with their friends on commando during the night,
and, to prevent this, an order was issued that no one
should pass the sentries posted around the town
after sundown or before sunrise, without a pass
from the military governor or from the field marshal
himself. The order was as imperative as could
be made, for the danger at that time was very great,
and it was necessary that even the smallest bits of
information should be kept from the Boer forces.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
A party of five Americans were dining at the house
of a friend on the opposite side of the line of sentries,
and, when the order was issued, it looked as
though we would not get back until the next morning.
One of the party suggested that we bluff our
way past the sentry at the bridge over which we
had to pass. The plan was adopted, and we walked
boldly up to the sentry post, and were promptly
challenged. One of the party stepped forward, and
in a tone of authority said, “These gentlemen are
Americans, and are with me, sentry, and it will be
all right. Just pass them too.”</p>

<p>“You are sure it will be all right, sir?” inquired
the sentry.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite sure,” was the answer, and the entire
party was passed without any further trouble,
and for all the sentry knew they might have gone
straight to the Boer camp, which was only a few
miles away; but owing to the fact that the party
was one apparently of gentlemen, he did not see fit
to refuse the permission to pass through the lines,
even though the field marshal had given his strictest
order to the contrary. This was not a single occurrence;
any person could pass through the lines at
any time, providing he did not speak English with
a Dutch accent. To do that was to arouse immediate
suspicion, and at times our own “Yankee
twang” was enough to cause the Tommy to ask
questions; but a few words of explanation invariably
brought a polite apology.</p>

<p>The Englishman makes a natural sailor, but he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
not a natural soldier, and it requires a great amount
of training to make a good man of him in the field;
he may drill well, march well, and look well, but he
needs much training and good leadership to fight
well. When he has that, there is no better soldier
to be found. It is in this respect that the Americans,
as well as the Boers, excel the English as soldiers.
They have been taught to hunt wild game
in the wilderness of the great plains and deep forests;
they have been taught to shoot and to ride in
their childhood. The reason is obvious—they are
a people of a new country; both Americans and
Boers have but recently fought back the way for
civilization, and, in fact, are still doing the same
thing. New York has forgotten the stress, Chicago
is fast forgetting it; but the great West has not
forgotten it at all, and everywhere in America the
spirit of adaptability to rough conditions still pervades
our life. Each year every man, woman, and
child who can get there seeks the mountains or
the woods for a few days or weeks, to satisfy the
natural American longing for the wild out-of-doors
life that our forefathers knew. But in England
there is no open shooting as we know it, there is no
camping as we know it. It is true that the great
estates have excellent shooting, so far as their idea
of hunting goes; but to our point of view it is a
senseless slaughter. Tame deer are driven up to
the guns to be shot, or domesticated wild birds
are flushed by beaters toward the hidden shooting
party. The size of the day’s bag depends merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
on the supply of ammunition or the endurance of
the trigger finger.</p>

<div id="i_71" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19.1875em;">

  <div class="caption">Heliographing from Diamond Hill to Lord
Roberts in Pretoria.</div></div>

<p>All this has to do with war only as it suggests
one reason why the British soldier has met his master
in the art of war in South Africa. The training
that makes a fighting man, if not a soldier, is hunting
where the snapping of a twig or the approach on
the wrong wind means the loss of the prey. Guns
and gunning are for the rich alone in England, and
the class that makes up the rank and file of the
army never have a firearm in their hands until they
enlist. It cannot be expected, therefore, that they
can become sufficiently proficient in its use to cope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
successfully in equal numbers with men who have
handled rifles since childhood. Not even the London
police carry firearms of any sort. The soldier is
taught to load and shoot, and learns his marksmanship
at the target ranges; but he might as well be
taught pigeon-shooting in a street gallery with a .22
calibre rifle. Target practice and firing in action are
different games, and the latter can be learned only
by actual practice if the instinct is not present.</p>

<p>When the British forces were landing at Beira, in
Portuguese East Africa, to make their march into
Rhodesia, there was a company of volunteers belonging
to “Carrington’s Horse,” already entrained
and ready to start for the front. In conversation
with one of the men I found that they were from
Edinburgh, and that the name of their company
was the “Edinburgh Sharpshooters.” Merely from
curiosity I asked what qualifications were required
to join their organization of sharpshooters, and
whether they had to make any particular score.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he said, “none of us have ever shot
a gun at all yet, but as soon as we get up here we
are going to learn.” When they left home they
wanted a name, and they liked that of “sharpshooter,”
so they took it. That is the way in
which many of the British soldiers are made; they
receive a uniform, a gun, and a farewell address,
and then it is thought that they are ready to meet
any foe. In some cases our own volunteers have
been as unqualified as were these young Scotchmen,
and we have suffered for it; but our men have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in general a better fundamental training than those
of most other nations. One mark of the difference
between Englishmen and Americans (and also Canadians)
is to be seen in the toy-shop windows. The
American boy’s first plaything, after he tires of tin
soldiers, is a toy pistol with paper caps. The boy
then begins to “play Indian,” and to shoot and
scalp his little sisters. In a few years, if he is
favored by fortune, he will have a little rifle, and
then the Winchester will follow. That boyish
training helped to make the Canadian and Australian
volunteers superior to the English troops,
and it is also in boyhood that the Boer farmer
learned to be the great fighter that he is. That
same mimic use of deadly arms in childhood, and
the constant use of guns against game in youth,
has made the North American Indian not only the
most formidable fighter in the world, but also the
world’s tutor in modern warfare.</p>

<p>Switzerland has adopted the idea of the advantage
of training in the use of firearms, and every
man is furnished with a rifle by the government,
and also with a certain amount of ammunition each
year. The people of that little republic could retire
into the fastnesses of her mountains and withstand
the armies of Europe for months. If Austria, for
instance, should again attempt to invade the cantons,
the Swiss would show the world that they can
do the same that the Boers have done, and at least
sell their land and liberty at a tremendous cost of
human life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
If the British common soldier is properly led, and
if he has full confidence in his leaders, he will go
anywhere; but he must be led, for he has no initiative
and does not think for himself in the field any
more than he does at home. What would an American
soldier think of a special privilege created in a
regiment because there came a time when all the
officers were killed or wounded, and the non-commissioned
officers took the regiment through the
fight? There is an English regiment in which the
non-commissioned officers all wear their sashes over
the same shoulder as do the commissioned officers,
because in a long-ago battle they led the regiment
when their superiors were put out of action. In
the American army this would have been done by
the non-commissioned officers as a matter of course,
or by privates if the sergeants and corporals were
disabled; and in the terrible slaughters of the Civil
War more than once this happened, demonstrating
the resourcefulness of the American soldier. While
talking with British prisoners taken by the Boers, I
asked them why they surrendered so soon, when
they had ammunition left and when so few had been
hit. Some of them said that it was much better to
be a prisoner than it was to be dead, and seemed to
take it more as a joke on the rest of the army that
still had to fight while they were now in safety.
Some of them blamed their officers. But not one
seemed to feel that it was at all incumbent upon the
privates to fight it out alone or to take the lead
when there was no officer near. In all the months<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of imprisonment in Pretoria and in the vicinity, the
soldiers did not make any attempt to escape, although
there were enough of them to have taken
Pretoria empty-handed. There were several thousand
British soldiers in one field enclosed in wire,
yet they made no effort to regain their liberty.
The reason undoubtedly was that they had no
leaders with them. In such an attempt some of
them, of course, would have been killed, and possibly
a great many of them; but there is no doubt
that with the proper spirit an escape could have
been made.</p>

<p>The care of the dead is a problem to which the
British government has not given much attention.
Certainly there is nothing in the field that would
indicate that it had been seriously considered. But
in this act of grace the American War Department
maintains a system which is in the highest degree
praiseworthy and which commands the deference of
the world.</p>

<p>It is purely a matter of sentiment that prompts
any particular disposition of the bodies of those who
fall in a fight, or who succumb to the ravages of
fever; but to the fighting man in the field it is a tender
sentiment that means much. The body of every
American soldier who falls on a foreign shore is
sooner or later brought home and buried, with all the
honors of war. If his family or friends want his
body for private burial, they are aided in securing it;
but if it is not so claimed, it is then taken to one of
the great national cemeteries and laid away with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
proper ceremonies. If one were to ask a soldier in
good health whether he wanted to be taken home to
be buried, he would probably reply that it did not
matter at all what was done with his body after he
got through with it. But if the time came when death
seemed near, that same man would find sensible satisfaction
in thinking that some day his own family would
stand beside the box that served as the narrow cell
of his last sleep. I have seen many a man die soothed
by the feeling that he would eventually be taken
home. In a severe campaign in a distant or foreign
land, the idea of home finds a meaning to matter-of-fact
and apparently unimaginative soldiers which
they cannot express, but which stirs infinite pathos.
When a soldier lies weak from a burning fever, but
with all his mental faculties more than ever alert, or
when he is on solitary outpost duty against an active
enemy, with time to turn the situation over in his
mind, it is then that he thinks of home as at no
other time, and it is then that he will appreciate all
that he knows will be done for him should he happen
to be found by death.</p>

<p>Whenever an American soldier falls in action or
dies of disease, he receives as good a burial as the
circumstances permit, and his grave is distinctly
marked, so that there will be no possibility of its
not being found when the time for removal comes.
It may be months before the day arrives, but it is
sure to come at last, and then the bodies are taken
up and put in leaden-lined coffins and transported

  <div class="caption">Burial at Arlington of 426 American soldiers who fell in Cuba.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
The year after the Cuban campaign I attended the
burial of four hundred and twenty-six officers and
men at Arlington, the great national cemetery on
the beautiful, sloping banks of the Potomac River,
opposite Washington. The President, the members
of the cabinet, the commanding general of the army,
and other high officials of state were there to pay
their respect to the noble dead as they were laid to
rest in the company of the thousands of others who
gave their lives for their country in the Civil War.
The long lines of coffins, each one draped with a
flag, resting beside the open graves, ready to be
lowered, told a heavy story of the breakage of war.
Two chaplains, one Protestant and the other Roman
Catholic, read the service for the burial of the dead,
while a soldier stood at each grave and sprinkled the
symbolic handful of earth upon the coffin. At the
end of the ceremony the artillery boomed the last
salute, and the trumpeters sounded the slow, mournful
notes of “taps.” The imposing funeral cost the
government a great amount of money. But each
year the soldier dead are gathered home; the dead of
every war our country has waged have been brought
together, a silent army of heroic men. These graves
will be cared for and the names will be preserved so
long as the nation lasts.</p>

<p>In South Africa the English forces buried their
dead with the honors of war whenever it was possible,
but not with the intention of taking the bodies
home at any future date; and in hundreds of cases
the graves were not even marked. There was not that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
deserved attention paid to the dead which seemed
often feasible, and which in some cases I felt that
Americans would have made feasible. In one instance
in Natal a Boer general sent a flag of truce to
the British general, whose forces had just met with a
severe defeat, and told him that a truce would be
allowed in which to bury the dead, and that if the
British general would send out a burial party it
would be given safe conduct and every assistance
in the work. The answer went back to the Boer
commander, “Bury them yourself and send us the
bill.” The Boers did bury them, and read a Christian
service over them, but they did not send in a
bill.</p>

<p>When rightly led, there is no braver soldier on earth
than the “gentleman in khaki” who goes out to do
his Sovereign’s bidding in every part of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
He is the finest specimen of the sturdy soldier known
in Europe. He is not unlike the American soldier,
except in the standard of education and self-reliance.
He is the same happy, careless, and kind-hearted
man, who will fight an enemy all day, and, when he
has been defeated, feed him out of his own scanty
store of rations. The British soldier does not often
become intoxicated; but when he does chance to
take too much, he is apt to be affected with a bit
more of dignity, or with an exaggerated straightness;
he is rarely quarrelsome.</p>

<p>The British soldier in the field is by far more attentive
to his personal and military appearance than
is the American soldier when on a hard campaign.
All the men in South Africa wore their heavy cross-belts
and pouches when, had they been our men, it
is quite likely they would have been lost, for they
were of no great importance to the comfort of the
soldier. The Britisher keeps well shaven at all
times in the field, and, although he is burned as only
an African sun can burn, he looks well groomed.
It does not seem to be compulsory to shave, as some
of the men are whiskered, but the large majority of
the men keep their faces free from a beard. Naturally,
however, their uniforms get very dirty, especially
as they do not have any shelter tents to protect
them from the rain, and frequently the regiments
on the march look as though they were uniformed
in black or a dark brown.</p>

<p>One thing in which the British soldiers are far behind
the American is in ordinary entrenching work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in the field; they do not seem to understand the
first principles of construction of trenches, either
temporary or permanent. The sappers or engineers
are, of course, proficient in the work, but the ordinary
infantrymen or cavalrymen do not go at the
work with the same intelligence that the Americans
display. This is not because they lack the intelligence,
but because they have never been trained for
that obviously necessary work, always having been
taught to rely upon the engineer corps. Nearly all
the men carry an entrenching tool, but they have not
had the necessary practice and instruction in its use
to make it a useful implement in their hands. The
American soldiers can do more and better work in
protecting themselves in a temporary trench with
the top of a mess tin than the British soldiers can
do with their special tools. This is not the fault of
the British soldiers, but that of the officers who have
neglected to train them in this most important self-protection
in the field. Dr. Conan Doyle calls the
infantry especially to account for their ignorance in
digging trenches in the South African war, and says
that the work they did were mere rabbit-scratchings
in comparison with the work of the amateur soldiers
opposed to them.</p>

<p>To compare the relative bravery of the American
soldier and Tommy Atkins is very difficult; there
is a difference, but it is undoubtedly due to the training
and not to the actual courage of the men. There
could be no better or braver soldier desired than the
British when he knows what to do and when he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
properly led; but the trouble is that he has not been
taught to think for himself, and the majority of his
officers do not take the trouble to think for him.
The consequence has been that the Boers took
more prisoners than they could feed. There are instances,
shamefully numerous, where a greatly superior
force has surrendered to the Boers after very
slight resistance. Howard C. Hillegas gives a number
of cases, in his book on the Boer war, where
from three to sixty men have been captured by one
or two Boers, without firing a shot in defense. It is
true that they were surprised in a mountainous or
rocky place, where they could not tell how many of
the enemy were opposed to them, but even this
would not excuse a bloodless surrender. I know of
one case where over seven hundred regular soldiers
surrendered to a few more than a hundred burghers,
after a loss of eight killed and twenty-three wounded,
and with their belts half full of ammunition. They
were not in the open, but were well covered, and in
as good a position as were the Boers. General Methuen’s
despatch to the War Office after one of his
first engagements, in which he described it as “the
bloodiest battle of the century,” after he had sustained
a ridiculously small loss, shows that to the
British mind losses are more disturbing than to the
American.</p>

<p>The Fifth Army Corps never would have reached
Santiago, and never would have driven out the Spanish
fleet, had they ever allowed themselves to be
checked as the British did in South Africa before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Lord Roberts came. At Guasimas the dismounted
cavalry, under General Young and Colonel Roosevelt,
attacked more than four times their number of
Spaniards, who were carefully entrenched in perfectly
constructed works, in a mountainous pass that
was thick with a tropical undergrowth. The enemy’s
fire was well directed and very heavy, and at one
time the cavalry attacking were fought almost to a
standstill; in order to save themselves they charged
the works, with a loss of sixteen killed and thirty-two
wounded. At El Caney and San Juan the
fighting quality of soldiers was shown on both sides;
and it was on those fields that the American gained
his first deep respect for the Spaniard as a fighting
man. All day long General Lawton’s division fought
every inch of the ground toward the little suburb of
El Caney under the stone fort, and General Kent’s
division advanced steadily, until there came the final
rush up San Juan hill. At the latter place the Spaniards
waited and fought until the bayonet drove
them out, and at the former they stayed and gallantly
died. Very few prisoners were taken at El
Caney, and almost every one of these was badly
wounded. The scene inside the stone fort was beyond
description. Captain Capron’s battery had hit
it forty-eight times during the day, and the little
force inside was literally shot to pieces; the walls
and roof had fallen in, and the floor was strewn with
the wreck, covering the bodies of the dead and
wounded. Blood was spattered over the walls that
were still standing, and the terrible tropical sun had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
caused a sickening odor. There was not a man in
the fort that was not hit, and only two or three were
still alive. Even after this fort was taken, which
was late in the afternoon, and we were busy burying
the enemy’s dead and caring for the wounded, the
Spaniards were still fighting at the thatched fort on
the other side of the town. The thought of surrendering
never seemed to enter their minds.</p>

<p>I was reminded of their bravery at Santiago by
Cronje’s noble stand at Paardeburg, where he withstood
the combined attack of forty thousand British
soldiers with many guns for twelve days. Although
he was in a defenseless position, and although the
number of men and animals killed caused a frightful
condition within his lines, still he held out until his
ammunition was entirely expended. Both the Spaniards
and the Boers went to the opposite extreme from
the British in the matter of surrendering, for there is
no doubt that in many instances the latter gave up
far too easily. So many of them surrendered during
the latter part of the war, that the Boers were
compelled, after they had disarmed them, to set
them free, as they had no accommodations or means
of caring for the thousands captured.</p>

<p>There is a significant contrast in the action of the
British and American governments regarding men
who are lost by capture. It is the policy of the
British government to make no effort to rescue them;
all the prisoners are made to pay allowances, and
promotion ceases from the date of their capture.
On the contrary, whenever any handful of American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
soldiers have been captured in the Philippines,
no possible efforts have been spared to release them;
in the case of the capture of Lieutenant-Commander
Gilmore and his men, a force of cavalry followed
them for several hundred miles, until finally, when
they overtook them, the rescuing party were in almost
as miserable a condition as were the prisoners
themselves. The circumstances in the Philippines
and South Africa are quite dissimilar, however, and
it was possibly good strategy on the part of Lord
Roberts to allow the prisoners to remain in the
hands of the Boers, as the responsibility for them
was necessarily a serious embarrassment for a small
force; and on this account he would not exchange
any prisoners.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that the death rate from disease
among the men in the British army while in the field
is not greater, for, not having a shelter tent of any
description, the men are compelled to sleep in the
open unless they happen to be able to provide a
temporary shelter for themselves. I have frequently
seen a rain storm of several days’ duration, where
the men were wet day and night and had no opportunity
whatever of drying their clothes. The
English army uses regular tents as much as we
do in our service, but in the actual field work, where
the company tents must be left at the base of supplies,
they are shelterless.</p>

<p>Not only are the British lacking in the giving of
shelter and comfort to the men while in the field, but
all the other European armies are also very backward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
in this respect—none of them using the shelter tent
as it is used by United States forces. This is a simple
and light portion of an equipment, which produces
more comfort for the men than anything else they
could possibly carry, for it is used in other ways than
as a shelter. In light marching order it is wrapped
around the blanket, forming the blanket-roll, the
sticks and pegs being wrapped inside; two men, each
carrying a half, sharing the tent.</p>

<p>In the out-of-door life of campaign, our men again
have the advantage of the training which is bound
to come from a new country where sleeping in the
open is not unusual. In the German army the men
are billeted upon the various towns or cities near
which they happen to make their night’s halt. The
German War Department has statistics showing the
capacity of every house in the empire, and wherever
a body of troops is moved, information is given to the
officers regarding the accommodations to be found.
Consequently, when a command marches into a village
or town, they are told off into squads and sent
to their respective quarters as easily as though they
were in their own barracks.</p>

<p>During the autumn manœuvres of the German
army in 1899, after watching the operations for the
day, I was sitting in a hotel, talking with some of
the staff officers, when one of them said in a most
mysterious manner, “Ah, but you must wait until
Thursday night!”</p>

<p>“What is to happen Thursday night?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said; “wait until then. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
wonderful.” And his brother officers shared his
mild excitement over the events promised for this
particular night. I had visions of all sorts of exciting
things—of night attacks, forced marches, or anything
up to a real declaration of war.</p>

<p>“But what is it?” I asked, growing intensely
interested.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “the army is going to bivouac all
night—in the open air—on the ground;” and then
he settled back to watch the effect of his startling
statement.</p>

<p>So unused to camping were they that the event
was looked forward to as children might look forward
to Christmas morning. It was the event of the
campaign, and the effect of putting these soldiers
into the field where there were no houses to be used
for shelter would be a problem.</p>

<p>The custom of the foreign governments of giving
medals to their soldiers for a campaign is an exceedingly
good one, and might well be copied to a degree
in the United States. There is a certain aversion in
this country for the use of national medals, and yet
there are quite as many in the form of military orders,
society orders, and decorations issued by the various
States, as are used in any European country. But
these all lack that distinguished origin and endorsement
which makes a man proud to wear them. The
British government is far in advance in the system
it has adopted for military decorations. A war
medal is struck after every campaign, and given to
every man who has shared in it, the soldiers receiving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a silver medal, and the camp-followers, drivers,
etc., a bronze one. They are worn with full dress,
and the ribbons are worn with fatigue dress or in
the field. The higher orders are the Victoria Cross,
which corresponds to our Medal of Honor, and the
“distinguished service” order, given for the same
kind of deeds for which the men of our army would
be mentioned in the order of that name, issued each
year by the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>It would be a very simple thing for our government
to issue a war medal after every campaign, to
be given to every man who had served in it. It is a
trinket of no intrinsic value, but the men who have
the right to wear it have gained it through hard-fought
battles and privations without number; they
prize these trophies superlatively, and their families
treasure them after they are dead. Our government
now issues several medals, and so the campaign
medal would be no departure from our custom.
It is always a pleasure to see the respect paid to
some old pensioner who carries an empty sleeve, as
he enters a room or climbs into a ’bus in London,
with the medal of the Crimea hanging to his coat.</p>

<p>The fighting man in the field commands respect, no
matter from what nation he may come, nor for what
cause he is fighting. He is one atom of a great
body that acts under the head and brain of one man,
and to a certain extent he reflects the personality
of his commander. But he is directly dependent upon
the officers over him, and it rests largely with them
whether he is to be considered a capable man or not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
The British soldier has been taught to rely absolutely
upon the judgment of his officers; and if he has
been found wanting, the blame rests with them and
not with him. No better war material could be desired
than the khaki man fighting in South Africa,
unless it be the man in the blue shirt fighting in the
Philippines.</p>

<p>This latter man represents the extreme of self-reliance
in the field; to that he has been trained by
his officers; for that his original intelligence and his
Yankee inventiveness have peculiarly fitted him.
With that self-reliance goes an American objection
to being dispirited under failure. When he is down
he does not stop regarding himself as “game”;
under awful odds he cannot see sense in surrender,
and if he does become a prisoner he schemes and
frets and digs and plots to escape. He is probably
the best fighting soldier in the world.</p>

</div>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">To</span> strike a comparison between the
British and the American officer, we
do not need to go further into their
military career than their first schooling
at the government institutions.
The fact that the English cadet receives
eighteen months’ training, ending
with an indifferent examination,
while the West Pointer is given four
years of the most difficult work, both
mental and physical, known to the
military world, indicates the whole
story.</p>

<p>Yet, up to the time of the breaking
out of the war in South Africa, the British officers were
generally considered to be at the head of their profession.
The colonies were taught to look up to them in
everything that pertained to the service; the European
and American War Departments considered
them models to be studied. But six months’ campaigning
against a practical and astute foe proved
many of them as clumsy of mind and as inefficient as
the officers of King George III. who surrendered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Gates and Washington. The modern British officer
has received the pin-prick of active duty against
modern fighters; his inflation has vanished.</p>

<p>The exposure was sure to come in his first meeting
with a clever enemy. It cannot be expected that a
man can become proficient in the art of war after
eighteen months’ superficial training, or after a year’s
service in the militia. In times of peace he leaves
all the duty pertaining to his regiment to his competent
non-commissioned staff, and his sole duty has
seemed to be to attend social functions, play polo,
cricket, or ride steeple-chases. The sergeant-majors
knew the work and did it; they attended to the tasks
that should have been done by the subaltern officers;
and they performed that work so well that the regimental
business proceeded in a neat and harmonious
manner, for which the officers took the credit.
Now comes the time when aptness in society, polo,
and cricket does not cut any figure in the problem to
be solved. Actual war with a keen-witted enemy
stares the gorgeous officers in the face, and they suffer
from their own ignorance simply because, with
all their personal courage—and there are no braver
in the world than some of them—they have not
learned their most obvious business.</p>

<p>In days gone by a couple of thousand pounds
would purchase a commission in almost any of the
Royal regiments; but that practice has been abolished
for one that is equally pernicious in its effects.
Now, while a man cannot actually purchase a commission
in the British army, almost any young man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of position who has sufficient income to sustain his
social rank can obtain the Royal warrant for the
asking. No British officer can support himself on the
pay allowed, and he is not expected to do so; it is
largely a matter of income whether or no a man receives
his commission. An English officer is paid
about half as much as an American officer, and his
expenses are many times greater. He must support
his clubs, and the stables for his polo, driving, and
riding stock; even the regimental band must be maintained
by a subscription from the officers, which of
itself would nearly exhaust his pay, since the British
army does not include any but field music in its enlistment.
This fact alone would make promotion
from the ranks practically impossible, although it is
permitted by the army regulations; but the officer’s
tale of necessary expenses and subscriptions requires
such a large private income that it is absurd for the
men in the ranks to dream of rising higher than the
non-commissioned staff.</p>

<p>There is no finer man living than the British officer
at home; his politeness rivals that of the Latin races,
and his hospitality could not be excelled by a Virginian.
He entertains in the most lavish manner, and
in time of peace he is an ideal soldier, and merits the
idolatry society gives him. His garrison duties do
not require his attention to the exclusion of any of
his pleasures; consequently he has time to devote
to his guests, and he entertains them in a superb
manner. The regimental messes are the most splendid
social institutions of England, and the guest-night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of a cavalry or Household regiment is scarcely outdone
in brilliancy at the royal court itself.</p>

<p>It was expected, however, that officers who devoted
so much time to the honor and appearance of their
regiments would at least be proficient in military
science; but, when the supreme test arrived, they were
found lacking, and what the observer in England
took for indifference to the work was in reality ignorance.
No one was half so surprised, however, at the
ignorance of the British officer as the British officer
himself. He was not able to realize that he did not
understand his profession; and to this day hundreds
of officers do not realize their ignorance, because so
many have not yet had the fortune to be brought
face to face with a campaign crisis sufficiently grave
to show them their own weakness.</p>

<p>It has been a popular idea that the effect of the
South African war will be to bind the colonies closer
to the mother country. But the ignorance that has
been displayed by some of the leaders of the imperial
forces is bound to have its effect sooner or later upon
the colonial dependencies, which heretofore have
looked upon the English officer as a military idol.</p>

<p>For some days after Pretoria was taken, I was
much in the company of officers of the Canadian
contingent, and their views of the South African situation
were refreshingly straightforward and enlightening.
I talked with a Toronto captain who wore
the ribbon of the Northwest Rebellion, and who had
served with Roosevelt in Cuba merely for the fun of
fighting, and I asked him what he thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
whole show. He was a man whose judgment was
sound, a man of the kind that we know as the sound
business man of this
continent—a character
with prestige almost
unknown in
England.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “it
isn’t the way we
would do it, is it?
We colonials have
been taught that nothing
we could do could
possibly be just right;
nothing we could say
could just suit the point; and we are brought over
here and dumped into
a country under a lot
of officers who don’t
know as much as a
child at home would
know about the same
game.”</p>

  <img src="images/i_096b.jpg" width="174" height="173" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Colonel Peabody, U. S. Volunteers.</div></div>

<p>Throughout the colonial
regiments that
sentiment was manifest,
for both the Australian
and Canadian
forces were volunteers
of the same type that constitutes the United States
volunteer army in time of war. Business men, professional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
men, and society men—all sorts and conditions—volunteered
from purely patriotic feeling; they each
went from a new country, where every man is to some
degree an adventurer. The same spirit that had sent
men to the colonies now sent men to the war. They
are men with intelligence and courage enough to
better their personal surroundings, and consequently
are capable of approaching a situation with daring
and executing it with success. While the colonials
were in the field in South Africa, I think their opinions
of the imperial officer took the shape of amusement
rather than contempt; but when they have
returned to their homes their derision is bound to
become scorn; for that great respect which they have
been taught to feel is broken, and they have suddenly
awakened to the fact that they of the New World
have outstripped the mother country in practicality.</p>

<p>The imperial officer did not hesitate to show his
contempt for the colonial officer; not because he
lacked intellect or bravery, or anything that a soldier
should have, but because his social position
was not equal to the English idea. It was the
old-time prejudice against “the man in trade;”
for the British society man cannot understand the
spirit and life of a new country, where every man,
rich or poor, of high or low birth, is what they call
“in trade.” The colonial officers felt this treatment
keenly, for they soon perceived their own
military superiority; although they did not make
manifest their sensitiveness, they resented the lofty
manner of the imperial officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
There was a most unexpected disclosure of character
in the conduct of many of the British officers
who were taken as prisoners of war by the Boers.
A great deal has been said on this subject, and
although the story has been told many times by
those who witnessed the exhibitions, it is flatly
denied by nearly all Englishmen, especially by
those who stayed at home.</p>

<p>During the first months of the war the British
officers who had been captured were quartered in
the Staats Model Schoolhouse, in the heart of
Pretoria. It is a handsome one-story brick building,
built according to the most approved plan of
what a modern school should be. At the rear is a
spacious yard, which served as a place in which the
officers might exercise. It was through this yard
and over the side fence that the war correspondent,
Winston Spencer Churchill, succeeded in making
his escape. Some of the officers who had been in
the prison at the same time were very bitter against
Mr. Churchill, as they say he anticipated a plot
planned by many of the prisoners by which a large
number could escape. As he escaped sooner than
the time agreed upon, it prevented the others from
making the attempt.</p>

<p>The Boer authorities were obliged to remove the
officers from the Model Schoolhouse to the open
country, on account of the unbecoming conduct that
some of them displayed towards the ladies of Pretoria
who lived in the vicinity or who happened to
be passing along the streets. It is the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
fact that some of the British officers made offensive
remarks to these ladies, and altogether acted in
a disgraceful manner. They defaced the walls of the
building shamefully, cutting it and drawing all sorts
of pictures upon it. An exception to this vandalism
was the exceedingly clever topographical work
of one of the officers in drawing a huge map of the
South African Republic and its surroundings. It
was, in fact, so cleverly done that, as the artist had
not time to finish it previous to the removal of the
prisoners to their new quarters, the Boer officials
requested that he continue the work, and allowed
him to return each day until it was completed.
When the building was renovated and the interior
defacings removed, this map was allowed to remain,
and it will be preserved.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no doubt of this disgraceful
conduct of some of the officers at the Model Schoolhouse,
and there is no doubt that this conduct was
the cause of their removal to the outskirts of the
town. It is persistently denied, but it remains a
fact, nevertheless, for instance after instance in
proof of it was narrated to me by the Boers. Indeed,
I myself had one remarkable occasion to witness
the discreditable conduct of certain of the
officers.</p>

<p>On my way to South Africa I had occasion to
stop at Cairo for about two weeks, waiting for an
East Coast steamer; and while at Shepherd’s I was
told that the commander of one of the Egyptian
regiments, a Colonel Kelly, had a son who was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
prisoner in Pretoria, from whom he had not heard
for many months. He had been captured early
in the war, and all attempts to communicate with
him had proved fruitless. Colonel Kelly expressed
the desire to meet me, as I was going directly
to the Transvaal capital. Consequently I had the
honor of a call from him. He is a magnificent
type of the Irish soldier, a man who has fought
in every zone and in every quarter of the British
Empire; one of those men who has cut the pathway
of civilization and progress for the statesman
to follow. Colonel Kelly requested me to take a
letter to his son and endeavor to deliver it to him
by obtaining permission from the Transvaal authorities.
I took the letter, and the second day after I
reached Pretoria I asked Secretary of State Reitz
what course to pursue so as to obtain permission to
deliver the letter. Although all the officials were
extremely considerate and glad to assist me in what
I desired to obtain, it took me several days to get
the passes required in order to see Lieutenant Kelly.
Finally, having obtained the necessary signatures to
several papers giving permission to deliver the letter,
I drove out to the officers’ prison, which was
about a mile from Pretoria, on the first slope of the
foothills.</p>

  <div class="caption">2. Barbed-wire prison, Pretoria, where the British
officers were confined after their removal from the city.</div></div>

<p>The prison consisted of a long, corrugated-iron
building, enclosed in a barbed-wire barricade, the
ground around the building covering several acres,
sufficiently large for the officers to play cricket,
football, or tennis. The barbed-wire entanglement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
was about six feet high and fifteen feet broad, and
was constructed as though three parallel fences were
interlaced with innumerable strands of loose wire.
There was never a very heavy guard at the prison,
as the impenetrable character of the enclosure made
it unnecessary that there should be more than a
small body of men on watch. A line of electric-light
poles followed the run of the barricade all
around the enclosure, and the lights were kept
burning throughout the entire night, making the
surrounding area as bright as day, to prevent escape
under cover of darkness. Such a construction
would not have long restrained the type of officers
who were prisoners of war in Libby or Andersonville.
The officers were fed better than was to have
been expected under the circumstances, since for
several months the food supply from the outer
world had been cut off from the Transvaal. They
were, indeed, receiving every day better rations
than the officers of the Transvaal army themselves
obtained. Their quarters were comfortable, each
officer having an iron cot in the large room, with an
ample supply of blankets and linen.</p>

<p>After obtaining permission to deliver the letter to
Lieutenant Kelly, I drove out to the prison. I had
not been within speaking distance of the enclosure
three minutes when some of the officers began loud
insults. They did not wait to ascertain why I was
there; to them I was merely a “Yank,” coming
there out of idle curiosity. A group gathered
around the entrance of the barricade and called out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
insultingly to me and to the Boer officials who were
with me, all of whom speak English with but a
slight trace of accent, if any at all. Some of the
Englishmen even went to the extreme of tossing
sticks and stones at our party. I made some comment
on this behavior to the commandant in
charge at the prison, and he replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, do not mind them; they always do this
sort of thing when any one comes out.”</p>

<p>Their derisive remarks were particularly pointed
towards Captain von Losburg, a German-American
who fought gallantly with the Boers, commanding
a battery of field artillery. Many of them knew
him by name, and among the English officers were
a large number who had personally surrendered to
him, and whose lives he had literally spared when
they begged him to cease firing in battle; and yet
they shouted insults to him beyond the limit of
endurance. Although his arm had been shattered
by a shell and he wore it in a sling, he told these
officers that he would gladly attempt to thrash any
one of them for their language. He had not brought
it upon himself, for he had not said a word before
they began to vituperate him; in fact, the same
thing had happened before, so he came forewarned
and endeavored not to heed their remarks. I was
thoroughly amazed, and could not believe that these
shameless men held the Queen’s commission; for
in my estimation there is nothing more unutterably
mean than for a prisoner of war to insult the man
from whom he has begged his life. If it had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
only myself upon whom they had poured their torrent
of abuse it would not have been so strange,
for to them I was an American who had cast my
lot with their enemy; and they did not know, for
they did not stop to inquire, whether I was fighting
or not. It was almost beneath scorn, however, for
them to abuse the man who had so recently befriended
them.</p>

<p>When I entered the prison enclosure to meet
Lieutenant Kelly, I was compelled to pass directly
through a large crowd of officers who had gathered
about the gate; as I did so I brushed elbows with a
number of them, but their offensive remarks continued
until I had passed into the building and out
of earshot. The commandant who was conducting
me asked some of the officers who were standing
about for Lieutenant Kelly, saying that there was a
letter awaiting him. A moment later an officer ran
up to me and said, in a manner full of excitement
and anticipation, “I hear you have a letter for
Kelly. For God’s sake give it to me, for I haven’t
had a line from home since I’ve been in this place.”
I was about to deliver the letter to him when the
commandant stopped him, saying gently, “I am
sorry, Captain, but this is for Lieutenant Kelly.”</p>

<p>Never was keener disappointment pictured on a
man’s face, and he staggered as though he had been
struck; but after an instant, making an effort to recover
himself, he half extended his hands with a gesture
denoting resignation, shrugged his shoulders,
and simply said, “Oh, I’m sorry!” and turned away.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
A few moments later I delivered the letter to
Colonel Kelly’s son, who was that day probably
the happiest man in the prison. He courteously
invited me to remain for a time and meet some of
his brother officers; but after having witnessed the
exhibition near the entrance I felt that I wanted to
get away from the place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Not many days after, the boom of the British
guns resounded in the valley; shells shrieked
over the prison and fell into the little city; and
on a day early in June a horde of khaki poured
over every mountain side, from every hill-top, and
flowed through the valley from every direction.
Pretoria was in the hands of the British, and these
prisoners were released after many weary months of
captivity. There was a wild scene of rejoicing about
the prison, and the captives embraced their rescuers,
fairly dancing for joy at the regaining of their liberty.
That afternoon, in the public square, when
Lord Roberts raised the Union Jack over the State
House, five of the English officers came up to me and
apologized for the conduct of their companions in
captivity on the occasion of my visit to their prison.</p>

<p>“It was a shabby thing for them to do,” said
one of them, “but then you know there are bound
to be cads in every lot.” I could not help thinking,
however, that there was a singularly large
number of cads in this particular lot, and also of the
many tales that I had heard from the Boers of similar
conduct on the part of other English officers when
they were first captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
My friend, Mr. Richard Harding Davis, went to
South Africa in complete sympathy with the British
cause, and joined General Buller’s army, seeing
much of the hardest campaigning on the Natal
side. He was fully convinced as to the rights of
the English cause, and equally firm in his opinion
that the Boers were all they had been depicted by
the press of Great Britain. A little later he had occasion
to withdraw from the British forces and transfer
his observations to the opposite side. He did
so with the full consent of the British authorities,
and without unfriendly disagreement. He had not
been with the Afrikanders very long before he
was persuaded of their cause, seeing how grossly
they had been misrepresented by men who wrote
without knowledge of the true state of affairs, or
who wrote in revenge after having been crossed in
some manner by the Transvaal authorities. Mr.
Davis saw that the men of these two South African
Republics were not the dirty, ignorant, bewhiskered
settlers that had been pictured, but that they were
clubmen, professional men, and business men of
every description and many nationalities, as well as
the typical farmers of the veldt known to illustrated
papers, and they were all fighting in a just cause and
defending their rights against territorial aggression.
This was also, I am safe in saying, the impression
of all the correspondents who had the opportunity
of observing the war from the Boer side, no matter
how warm had been their early prejudice in favor
of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. Davis went to the war as heartily prejudiced
in favor of the British officers as of the cause of
England; but because he has had sufficient strength
of character and love of fair play to change his sentiments
and the tenor of his writing completely, he
has been malignantly attacked for making the same
statement that I have just made regarding the personal
conduct of the British officers. Nevertheless,
this statement is a fact that remains absolutely true.
It seems incredible that such demeanor could have
been manifested, and I am free to confess that
had I not been a witness I would not have believed
it.</p>

<p>I could not but think of the contrast shown between
these captured Englishmen and the Spanish
officers who surrendered during the fighting in the
war with Spain. They were compelled by the fortunes
of war to put themselves in the keeping of the
officers of a different nation, a different race; men
whom they had been taught to despise and for
whom they really had a bitter hatred. Yet they
could not have been more courteous had they been
guests instead of prisoners. Admiral Cervera and
the officers of his fleet were for a time quartered at
Annapolis, and later in one of the New England
sea-coast towns, where they enjoyed many privileges
of recreation and liberty. They met our American
women each day during their term of captivity, and
their conduct showed most conclusively their gentle
breeding. When they came in direct meeting with
any of the ladies, they raised their caps with grave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
respect; in many cases they were formally presented,
and they invariably proved themselves the
gentlemen of refinement that officers are supposed
to be. When they met any of our officers, they
never failed to give the military salute, showing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
respect in which they held their captors, notwithstanding
the bitterness in their hearts. Their demeanor,
which won the admiration of all our people,
was in marked contrast to that of some of the British
officers towards their captors.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the South African War I
was not without a wish that our government might
have arrived at an open understanding with the
British Ministry. After their gracious attitude
towards us in the latter part of the Spanish-American
War, it looked as though Englishmen might be
sincere in their friendship. One of the titled staff
officers following Lord Roberts was, to put it very
mildly, exceedingly discourteous to one of the
American correspondents whose papers were of
considerable influence upon public sentiment. In
discussing the incident with one of General French’s
highest staff officers, I asked if it would not have
been better had this officer been a trifle more diplomatic
and, by a little courtesy, made a friend
rather than an enemy of a man whose writings
reached so many American readers. This officer’s
answer struck the keynote of the British sentiment
when he replied:</p>

<p>“We do not care a tuppenny damn what any
American on earth thinks of us!”</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes that same officer asked
whether America would not stand by England in
the event of a European war.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the English-speaking
peoples should stand together. But my recent experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
at the seat of war, in London, and at
other European capitals, has convinced me, against
my will, that we must be slow in having faith that
England is our friend. If the occasion required she
would not hesitate to point her guns towards us,
and her friendship would be turned to hostility in
an hour. More true friendliness towards America
exists in Germany or Russia to-day than in England.
There is a serious fallacy in the premise that because
we speak the language of England we are
more closely allied to that country than to any
other.</p>

<p>To return from the digression, the army officer
of to-day, to be a complete success, must be exceedingly
versatile in his accomplishments. He
must not only be a careful student of the science of
war, but he must also be a thorough business man.
He must not only understand the tactics of attack
and defense, but he must be able to tell the quality
of hay and of butter. He must understand weights
and measures as accurately as an ordinary shop-keeper.
Real war of this day has a great deal of
everything except fighting. Hundreds of men and
officers go through an entire campaign and never
hear a shot fired; instead, they study columns of
figures, great sheets of warehouse returns, and manifold
way-bills of freight shipments. They may
worry over the price of wheat or the weight of live
stock on the hoof, but never over bullets or bayonets.
The only orders they give are written on
little slips of “flimsy,” such as you see the station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
agent hand into the cab to the engineer just before
the train pulls out. The only possible difference
between this sort of an officer and a regular business
man is that the officer wears a uniform and
works much harder for less money.</p>

<p>During the Cuban campaign, and, in fact, ever
since, the American officers have been called upon
to perform every duty that man could do; and,
greatly to their credit, they have in almost every
case performed their tasks creditably. When in
Havana with General Ludlow’s staff, for the first
five months following the American occupation, I
had an excellent opportunity to see the real worth
of the American officer outside of his fighting qualities.
Colonel Bliss was taken from his regiment
and made Collector of the Port, and has performed
the duties of that very peculiar and trying office,
with raw clerks, incomparably better than it had
ever been done before. Captain Charles G. Treat
and Major Pitcher sat on the judicial bench and
meted out justice in the police and criminal courts.
Colonel Black suddenly found himself a superintendent
of streets and of public works. Major
Greble became the custodian of the poor. In fact,
every office, from that of the governor-general
down, in the entire government, was occupied by
an army officer, whose performance of the new duty
was more thorough and practical than could have
been expected from most civilians. Not only were
these officers called upon to attend to all matters of
ordinary routine, but they were compelled to restore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
destroyed records, to delve into the land titles of the
island, and to handle problems of a delicate nature
which would seem to require the study of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Not only the officers of the army, but also the
officers of the navy, have had charge of an administration
difficult and complicated; and in every case
they have met the requirements of their unmilitary
duty. The great majority of instances where this excellent
work has been accomplished are hidden away
in the records of the departments, and the men will
never get the slightest notice for what they have
done—because they did it well.</p>

<p>On this executive side of the modern soldier’s
duty the British officers are also abundantly deserving
of admiration for business-like efficiency.
The selections made for civil administration in captured
territory were, on the whole, fortunate. Especial
credit belongs to the Army Service Corps,
through whose splendid management the stupendous
task of supply and transportation from the
ends of the earth to the interior of Africa was
effected without breakdown. There is, however,
no comparison between the American and the
British officers in the knowledge of their strictly
military profession. This is not to be wondered at
when their difference in training is considered. One
has been taught to be a social success, while the
other has been trained to be a man of tempered steel,
being compelled to pass at each promotion an examination
of which not half the officers of the British
army could meet the requirements.</p>

  <div class="caption">General Ian Hamilton in South Africa.</div></div>

<p>Until it comes to the critical test, however, the
British army gets along just as well as though the
officers worried themselves about the fine principles
of the art of war. It is astonishing how dependent
the officers are upon their men. One morning,
while with General French’s staff during the operations
in South Africa, I was waiting for a man to
put the saddle on my horse; being rather impatient,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
as an action was expected, I remarked to one of the
staff officers standing by that I would not wait, and
so picked up my saddle, swung it on the horse, and
began to cinch it up. The officer watched me in
an interested, half-amused way for a moment, and
then said, “My word! but you’re clever!” I
asked what he meant. “Why,” he answered, “you
can saddle your own horse.” “Most certainly,”
I replied; “can’t you?” “Well,” said he, “I
suppose I could, although I have never tried, for
my man always does that.” And that man was a
cavalry officer.</p>

<p>A signal difference between the English and
American officer is that the former cannot forget
his Piccadilly manner when he is in the field; while
the latter, no matter whether he is a regular or a
volunteer, once in the field he is a soldier through
and through. There are some of this type in the
British service, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>One of the most typical soldiers I have ever seen
in any service was Colonel Beech, now a captain of
the Reserve, who was for about ten years commanding
an Egyptian regiment of cavalry. He is still a
young man, but he has had more experience in war
than usually comes to any ten men. He has seven
clasps to his Egyptian medal, having been in every
campaign waged about the Nile by the British in
conquering the country. He is a man of enormous
force, and perfect knowledge of all branches of military
work, and is to-day a better soldier than the
majority of generals who are commanding. He is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
much the same type of man that Kitchener is, and
naturally, as he was trained in the same school.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts is also a splendid type of the fine
soldier, who has solved his problems, with all their
difficulties, as a master genius of war. His critics in
London contended that he was not severe enough in
his handling of the people of the two Republics.
But Lord Roberts understood the people he was
dealing with, and sought to use conciliatory methods
on that account. The present British army and the
present generation in England have been accustomed
to exceedingly harsh measures against their foes,
who have usually been of half-civilized races; measures
which were absolutely necessary in order to
make any impression upon the sort of enemy they
were fighting. The conditions during the present
war are entirely different, and Lord Roberts has done
all that he could—all any man could do—to bring
matters to a close. It is deplorable that such a
magnificent soldier should be unfairly criticised by
those who keep at home. They do not realize that
the prolonging of the war is not the fault of their
general, but is due to the unconquerable spirit of
the men whose country they are invading.</p>

<p>The two wars of the last three years have overthrown
a great many traditions, suppositions, and
theories regarding various branches of military service,
both in the navy and the army; and a new
collection of facts now stands in their stead. The
American army has been hampered by the uncertainty
of the theory, while the army of the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Empire has been
bound to the traditions
of past centuries
to such a degree as
to cost immeasurably
the lives of thousands
of her bravest men,
and to cause a series
of useless disasters
and defeats, nearly
all of which can be
laid almost directly
to incompetent officers
of the sort that
carry canes on active service and have tea served
by body-servants every afternoon.</p>

<p>An Australian war
correspondent, Mr.
Hales, has recently
given his opinion of
the British army in the
London <cite>Daily News</cite>.
He says: “I don’t suppose
Australia will ever
ask another Englishman
to train her volunteers.
If there was one
British institution your
colonial believed in
more than another it
was the British army.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Their belief in the British army is shattered. The
idol is broken.” He describes the officers as men
“with their eye-glasses, their lisps, their hee-haw
manners, their cigarettes, their drawling speech,
their offensive arrogance, their astonishing ignorance,
their supercilious condescensions, their worship
of dress, their love of luxury, their appalling
incompetence.</p>

<p>“Many a soldier I’ve asked why he scuttled.
‘Tommy, lad, why did you run, or why did you
throw up your hands?’ I’d say.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the use of being killed?’ he’d answer.
‘’E don’t know where ’e are,’ meaning his officer.
‘I’d go anywheres if I’d a man to show me the
way.’</p>

<p>“I believe if Kitchener had been chief in command
he’d have shot some of those officers who surrendered.
If the army is to be reformed it is with this
class of young man they will have to start. Let him
understand that soldiering is hard, stern business,
and not play. The average officer hasn’t a mind
above golf or cricket. He knows nothing of drill.
He can’t ride. The mounted infantry is a farce.
A Boer’s horse is a part of him. If there is a body
of them, and you watch them through a glass, each
man is off, has taken cover and led his horse away
before you can say ‘knife.’ But watch a body of
British. They have to wait for orders before they
dismount; cover has to be pointed out to them;
they have no initiative. Napoleon got his officers
from the ranks. Who would make such a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
officer as a sergeant-major? Instead of glory
when they come home—glory and guzzling—some
of the officers should get three years—you know
where.”</p>

<p>This is what the colonials have begun to think of
the imperial officers, and it is a growing opinion.
Let me not be understood to infer that there are no
worthy or intelligent officers; there are hundreds of
them who understand all the details of war thoroughly,
but they are tremendously hampered by the
men of the other class. The British Empire has
not the advantage of the great reserve of leaders,
men who, like General Fitzhugh Lee, General Joseph
Wheeler, and hundreds of others, have had years of
experience in actual war. These are the men who
are the mainstay of a nation while the younger generation
are getting their baptism of fire.</p>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">The</span> Spaniards might have done better
if they had not been so impressed
with the unknown in the
tactics and strategy of the American
invaders. The Boers erred in
having too much contempt for the
British methods. After their series
of extraordinary victories over superior
forces at the beginning of
the war, it was a common saying in
Pretoria, “Fifteen or twenty of
you men come up here; a British
regiment is coming.” The echo of
this jeer was at the evacuation, when a burgher said
to me, as he swung himself on his pony, “If we
only had even terms, like fifteen or twenty to one,
we could lick them; but when they come forty to
one we can’t do anything.” It is a mortal mistake
either to overestimate or underestimate your enemy.</p>

<p>Tactics and strategy extend into technical military
science, and can be treated in nice detail only by
expert students. The following observations are
offered accordingly, not from any technical point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
view, but as the witness of one who on the field has
watched the operations of a number of campaigns,
and who has tried to see things not merely as they
seem at the hour, but also as they look afterwards.</p>

<p>Tactics are not to be confounded with strategy.
Strategy, speaking largely, is the planning of the
thing which an army has to do; tactics is the manner
in which an army does it. The strategy of a
campaign may be carefully planned by the wise men
of the War Department or by the commanding general.
It may be infallible on paper; but if the tactics
of the general officers in the field cannot follow
the lines thus laid down, the strategy is a drag
anchor on the success of the army. On the other
hand, the tactics according to which the troops are
disposed, moved, and fought may be so unpractical,
so poorly adapted to the conditions of the country
and of the hostile force, that the best conceived
strategy will be made foolish.</p>

<p>In strategy the conditions of the Cuban and
African campaigns were so dissimilar that a comparison
is less significant than in tactics. The
American War Department planned an invasion of
Cuba near Havana. The spot actually selected was
Mariel, a few miles west of Havana. Here, under
cover of the fleet, a fortified camp, as a base of operations,
was to be established, and Havana was to
be invested. Admiral Cervera’s fleet, however, was
first to be destroyed, the equipment of the army
gathering at Tampa was to be completed, and the
unhealthy summer season was to be escaped as far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
possible by the delay. There seemed to be no other
objective than Havana, for there were over 100,000
Spanish troops behind fortifications, the strength of
which was never known until they were evacuated
at last without a blow. Had those formidable works
been attempted, the carnage would have been more
frightful than the worst of the South African battles.</p>

<p>But the unexpected happened, and changed the
entire strategy of the campaign. Cervera sailed
into Santiago Harbor and refused to come out. To
aid the navy in destroying him an army corps was
despatched to Santiago, and the capture of that
stronghold, together with the annihilation of the
Spanish fleet, led Spain to acknowledge defeat.
Thus the first strategic plan, which was both correct
and costly, was abandoned in a sudden exigency for
a diversion on a small scale, which turned out to be
decisive. In all this development of strategy there
was nothing histrionic; there was only an obvious
common sense which suggests the method of sound
business men going at a problem with determination
and yet deliberation, with economy and yet quickness
of adaptation. The first blow of the war at
Manila was dramatic enough, but it was also plain,
business-like strategy, which had been for silent
months in preparation; and the final blow in Porto
Rico was likewise very good business. Upon the
whole, a survey of the problem offered by the conditions
of the Spanish war reveals a shrewd and
unerring strategy on the part of the United States.
On the other hand, while we came to respect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Spanish in the highest degree as brave and dutiful
men, we cannot regard the strategy of the Spanish
War Office as anything but puerile. Spain saw the
war coming before we did, and she might have put
up a far better fight with no greater loss.</p>

<p>In overcoming the Boers Great Britain had a
problem of appalling magnitude. Her soldiers
were to be transported from the ends of the earth
to the Cape, and then to march as far as from New
York to Denver before they could reach the enemy’s
capital. Their line of communication was to be
guarded in force at every bridge, trestle, and causeway
for the whole of that immense distance. Cape
Colony, the base of operations, was itself almost a
hostile country. Three besieged British garrisons
were to be relieved, and they required three diverging
armies of rescue. The keeping up of the soldiers’
spirits over such a prodigious march, and the
maintenance of the trains that fed them, constituted
a problem such as no other army of this century has
had to face. That the War Office in London did
undertake it, and did actually overcome the natural
obstacles which were more formidable than any
fighting force that could meet the British in the field,
showed a mental comprehension and perspicacity,
as well as a perfection of organization, that has
properly engaged the admiration of every strategist
in Europe. Whatever blunders of tactics in the
field were thrown up by incompetent officers, there
was a big, clear brain behind it all, that knew the
immense business, kept it going, saw beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
diverging armies, effected a concentration, captured
the capitals of two states, and accomplished military
results that seemed impossible. The strategy accomplishing
all this is of the very first order, and
is a power which the warrior nations of the world
must take into account.</p>

<p>In the tactics displayed by the American and
British armies there is naturally a more proper
ground for comparison than in the strategy of the
two recent campaigns. Strategy is necessarily the
variable quantity depending on combinations of
conditions; but tactics, as the immediate methods
of accomplishing the requirements of strategy, are
to be judged by the invariable gauge of practicalness.</p>

<p>The tactics of the American soldier have been the
outcome of generations of Indian wars and of fighting
in woods and mountains. Our colonial forefathers
established the general principles of our
present fighting methods when they learned the art
of warfare from the natives of the wilderness.
When Colonel Washington saved General Braddock’s
defeated British regulars from annihilation
by the Indians, he employed, in the main, the same
tactics we now use. Washington implored the
British general to dispose his men like the pioneer
volunteers, as individual fighters; but the Royal
officer disdained to take lessons from a colonial.
The British stubbornness was in the end fortunate
for the colonies, for the American victories of the
War of Independence were won by the common-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>sense
tactics natural to men who had handled long
rifles from their boyhood, and who had learned to
hide first and shoot afterwards. The slaughter of the
retreat from Concord to Boston, the terrible losses
at Bunker Hill, the defeats at Bennington and Saratoga,
were the work of men who sighted their foe
with the same precision that they aimed at wildcats,
and took as few chances as possible themselves.</p>

<p>During that war an attempt was made by Washington
to introduce the Prussian tactics into the
continental army. Baron Steuben drilled the raw
frontiersmen according to the rules of the Great
Frederick, and the result was unquestionably advantageous,
as the men gained military form and
learned discipline. Had the Boers submitted themselves
to such discipline and obedience to commanders,
had they been content to do more “team
work” and less determined to fight as individuals,
they might not have lost their positions. But the
American continental, with all his new-fangled discipline,
never forgot that he was out to kill rather
than to drill; he was a hunter, and the pomp of
volley firing never led him to waste powder and
ball. He kept his head, and his finger stayed on
the trigger until the sights on the rifle had a perfect
alignment on a red coat.</p>

<p>But while the colonial idea of war has ever been
a persistent influence upon the tactics of the army
of the United States, the troops of King George
sailed back to England without an idea that their
methods needed mending. Their success against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Napoleon was not due to reformed tactics, but
because in fighting quality, man for man, they were
better than the French, and because they had plenty
of allies. Barring the Crimea, the wars of Great
Britain since Waterloo have not been against white
men until they attacked the Boers. Whatever
adaptations of method were made in fighting Asiatic
tribesmen, the general tactics of the army in the
field seemed to experience no radical change until
the world was horrified to see General Buller charging
up kopjes against magazine rifles and machine
guns in not far from the same formation in which
Howe had led his men to slaughter on Bunker
Hill.</p>

<p>There was a vast difference between those South
African frontal attacks at the beginning of the war
and the charges up the hill of El Caney and San
Juan in Cuba. The American assault was sanguinary
enough, and the resistance was more desperate
than that offered by the Boers. But had the blue
shirts marched up in columns of fours, or swept up
in the old-fashioned line of battle of the Civil War,
the carnage would have turned to annihilation.
They scattered, they abandoned all formation, they
crawled, they sprinted from one poor shelter to
another; they knew what the Mauser rifle would do,
and they adapted their offensive tactics to it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the traditions of Waterloo and
Balaklava prevailed at Spion Kop, Colenso, and
along the Tugela and Modder rivers. To “get in
with cold steel” seemed to be the ruling thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
among the officers during the terrible first months
of the campaign.</p>

<div id="i_128" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="346" height="245" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Boer fighting men watching a British flanking
movement during the battle of Pretoria, while
building defenses.</div></div>

<p>But the lesson was learned, eventually, that the
long-range rifle, with its incessant fire and the Boer
precision of aim, required a complete change in
offensive operations. After the disasters to Buller
and Methuen the tactics developed into operations
more creditable from a modern point of view. With
the advent of Lord Roberts, flanking became the
feature of the British advance. The Boer forces
have never been of sufficient strength to withstand
a flanking movement by the British; they have
always been compelled to withdraw whenever the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
flanking columns reached a point that would menace
their retreat. When the British came into Pretoria,
the officers and correspondents all complained of
what they called lack of pluck in the Boer as a
fighter, as shown in the operations north of Bloemfontein;
but in no instance at that part of the campaign
did they have an opportunity to defend
themselves against purely frontal attack, like those
in which General Buller made himself conspicuous
for his fatal old-fashioned tactics. Lord Roberts’s
army was in sufficient strength, so that he could
employ a main force of infantry and artillery of
from 30,000 to 40,000, and could send out flanking
columns, of cavalry and mounted infantry with a
few horse batteries, of about 10,000 each.</p>

<p>Thus, when a Boer position was developed, the
main advance took an artillery position at long
range and maintained an incessant shell fire, while
the mounted troops were sent out on either flank
in an attempt to cut off the retreat of the burghers.
As soon as these flanking columns reached a certain
point from which a junction of the two forces might
be made, the Boers were compelled to withdraw,
in many cases without firing a shot. Sometimes
this column of cavalry or mounted infantry would
be fifteen or twenty miles away on their flank; but
owing to their admirable signal service and their
perfect scouting they were able to keep informed as
to the enemy’s whereabouts, and at the last moment,
just before a junction was made to cut off
their retreat, they would slip through. Cronje’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
capture at Paardeburg was due to the fact that he
misjudged the movements of the troops on his
flank. His officers begged him to retire, but he
insisted on holding the position one day longer.
That delay of one day proved to be fatal; on the
next morning he was surrounded by about 40,000
of the enemy, with overwhelming batteries. After
twelve days of the most heroic defense, when his
ammunition was expended, and the action of the
heat on the dead bodies in his laager made it intolerable,
he was compelled to surrender. That was
the only time the British succeeded in capturing any
large number by the flanking movement, although
they always succeeded in preventing any serious
opposition to their advance.</p>

<p>The country which has been the scene of operations
in South Africa seemed designed by nature for
defensive operations. In the Orange Free State the
veldt stretches away for miles and miles, broken by
single kopjes and short ranges of mountains, from
which a sentinel can note the approach of a hostile
force in the far distance. In the Transvaal, although
the country is more broken, it is easy to watch the
enemy’s approach; and with the excellent signal
service of the Boers it has been practically impossible
for an advancing column to surprise the defending
force.</p>

<p>The drifts or fords of the rivers were the most
serious difficulty that had to be overcome by the
British in transportation of their wagon-trains and
artillery. By long action of the water in the rivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
they have been cut deep, so that the descent from
the ordinary level of the country to the bed of the
stream is at most places very sharp. Strangely,
there was no attempt, except at the railway bridges,
to improve in any manner these difficult fords, although
in many cases an hour’s work by a company
of engineers, or by any kind of a company, would
have saved many hours’ delay in the transportation.</p>

<div id="i_131" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="342" height="205" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">British soldiers pulling army wagons across
a drift.</div></div>

<p>I stood at one ford for over three hours, watching
the passage of a wagon-train which might have been
taken over in a single hour had the bed of the river
been cleared of stones and rocks, as would have
been done by the first American officer to pass that
way. The water was not more than eighteen inches
deep, and the obstructing rocks could easily have
been picked up by hand, and a way cleared by a
dozen men. Instead of that, a long wagon-train was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
taken over, with every wheel in the train in jeopardy,
and with a total wrecking of two wagons. At
some drifts the descent into the river and the ascent
of the opposite bank was so steep that the animals
had to be assisted by a company of men with a long
rope attached to the wagon, to ease it down and
haul it out. This was the regular custom at a
drift within twelve miles of Pretoria, where there
was every facility for bridging, and where a company
of sappers could have constructed a span in a
few hours that would have stood during the rest of
the occupation of the district.</p>

<p>At the foot of San Juan hill, in Cuba, there was a
ford of a river where the bottom was perfectly hard
and smooth, and after the barbed wire entanglements
laid by the Spaniards had been removed, it
could have been used without bridging and without
any serious loss of time. But as the river banks
were steep the engineers quickly threw a span across,
using the thick bamboo which abounds in the jungle;
and this adequate bridge allowed the men to be sent
forward on the advance in better time and in better
condition. Similar tactics could have been employed
at many passages in South Africa that would
have greatly assisted in the operations, but for some
reason, and at great cost, they were neglected.</p>

<p>In the use of the balloon the British showed high
proficiency and effectiveness throughout the entire
campaign. The huge silken bag was attached to
a heavy wagon, and was drawn, fully inflated, by a
span of thirty or forty oxen. The successful use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
this auxiliary was facilitated by the open nature
of the country. The information obtained thus was
exceedingly valuable to Lord Roberts during his
advance towards Pretoria. Not only, however, is
it a material advantage to a force to possess this
direct method of getting information, it also has a
certain moral effect upon the enemy that is in itself
powerful. This is somewhat similar to the effect
that a heavy artillery fire has upon well-intrenched
infantry; the shells are not apt to hurt anybody—indeed,
a heavy artillery bombardment of field intrenchments
is usually as harmless as a political
pyrotechnic display, except for the trying effect on
the imagination and nerves of the men who are
being fired at. But the Boers were bothered more
by the balloon than by ballooning shells.</p>

<div id="i_133" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="340" height="175" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Boer artillerists waiting under shell fire for the
British advance.</div></div>

<p>One day I was lying in the Boer trenches under
an exceedingly heavy artillery fire, which the burghers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
did not mind more than a hailstorm. They were
well under cover of the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">schanzes</i> which they had
built along the ridge of the kopje, and they were
calmly awaiting the British advance, smoking and
chatting in nonchalant fashion, without a trace of
nervousness. Suddenly some one spied the balloon
as it slowly rose in front of us, and its apparition
created a perceptible consternation for some moments.
This agitation was not fear, for the Boers
knew perfectly well that danger was no more imminent
than before; but the thought that the enemy
from whom they were concealing themselves could
see them as perfectly as though the mountain were
not there certainly got on their nerves.</p>

<p>The work of the balloon corps was valuable in
that it could discover to the artillery the position
not only of the fighting line, but also of the reserves
and of the horses, and of the line of retreat. The
mid-air observer before Pretoria found and pointed
out the range of the railway line leading towards
Middleburg, by which the retreat was being made,
so that the naval guns began to shell the line,
hoping to break it by a lucky shot, or to disable a
train. As it happened, however, the trajectories
did not strike the narrow lines of rails, but they did
cause the American Consul, Mr. Hay, some inconvenience,
as they filled his consulate full of holes,
though he kept on calmly at his work; finally a
sympathetic neighbor sent over his compliments and
suggested that they have tea together in the lee of
his house; everybody else in that vicinity had fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
But if the balloon was an important feature of
tactics in South Africa, it cannot be said that the
Americans in Cuba made a brilliant success of it.
The balloon before Santiago proved a boomerang,
since the officer in charge was a trifle too enthusiastic
and too anxious to keep his toy on the firing
line. The advance towards San Juan hill was made
through a jungle through which only one road led
by which the troops could move forward. Just
below the hill along the military crest of which
the Spanish trenches were built, the undergrowth
stopped, leaving an open area several hundred yards
wide across which the final charge was to be made.
The regiments moved forward along this narrow
road, and deployed as best they could through the
undergrowth. The reserves were held at a fork of
the river, about half a mile back, huddled together
in a very small space. Just in front of the reserves
was an open ground. Thinking only of the balloon’s
convenience, but thoughtless of the danger to
the reserves, the signal-service men planted their apparatus
here and began to inflate the mounting bag.</p>

<p>As soon as the balloon was prepared it was
ordered into the air, and instantly it became the
target of the Spanish artillerists. It was hit several
times, though without apparent effect; but the
shells that missed it broke into the crowds of the
reserves. Shell after shell found that unseen target,
killing and wounding large numbers. Thus the
Spaniards inflicted their greatest injury upon our
troops without knowing they were doing so. Aides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
were rushed forward to get the fatal thing somewhere
else; but it was already winged and sinking
to the earth. After that melancholy fiasco it was
folded away and not used again. This unfortunate
blunder should not, however, be permitted to discredit
the use of the balloon in our army. The
notable success of the British in operating it, and its
helpfulness to them, amply demonstrate its practicality.</p>

  <div class="caption">The battle of Pretoria, June 4, 1900; Boer guns in action; British advance
along the first range of hills.</div></div>

<p>The tactics of Lord Roberts at the capture of
Pretoria were badly at fault. The taking of that
city was attended by a glaring military blunder unexpected
from that great leader. It seemed to be
the commander’s only idea to get into the town
and to occupy it, rather than to cut off the enemy’s
retreat and capture him. The advance was made
along the road from Johannesburg, the main force
being composed almost entirely of infantry and
artillery. The customary flanking movements were
commenced. Hutton’s division of mounted infantry
swung around one flank for a short distance.
French’s cavalry division started around the other
flank, but did not get very far before the fighting
ceased. It happened that General Botha had not
defended Pretoria, and the action that lasted during
the entire day of June 4th was merely a rear-guard
action, to cover the retirement of the main force.
Consequently, no matter what course Lord Roberts
might have pursued, he could not have captured
more than 1,500 prisoners. But the British commander
did not know the state of affairs in Pretoria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and was led to believe that he would be opposed by
the concentrated commandoes of General Botha and
General de la Rey. Had such been the case his
tactics would have allowed the escape of the entire
force, as they did allow the slipping away of the
rear guard. Had the field marshal delayed the attack
of the main body for another day, or even
two days, and allowed his mounted troops to get
well into the rear, he could have cut off the retreat
of the burghers. Instead, his premature frontal
attack in force compelled them to retire under the
cover of darkness long before their flanks were even
threatened.</p>

<p>The miscarriage seemed like another case of
British superciliousness towards their foe, which
has repeatedly cost them so dear. After Bloemfontein
the Boers had been kept so on the run that, to
some minds, the employment of costly strategy on
the part of the British might seem needless. They
were in such tremendous force compared to the
number of Boers opposing them that they rolled
down over the veldt, a flood of khaki, irresistible in
power. If they were opposed at one point of the
advance, they merely kept on marching either side
of the threatened position, until the flanking movement
compelled the Boers to withdraw. The British
did not seem to attempt actually surrounding
and cutting off the retreat of the Boers, but were
content with merely driving them back. The inadequacy
of this plan was clearly manifest after Pretoria
had been reached, for the force of their enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
was not in the least broken. On the contrary, the
burghers showed conclusively that they were the
strategic masters of the situation. Nothing but
their masterly movements saved them from defeat
and capture early in the war; and after Pretoria,
when the London press began to call the Boers
guerrillas, wandering brigands, and outlaws, there
was just as clever strategy shown in the manner in
which the Transvaal and Orange Free State leaders
handled their men as though a mighty army had
been at their command.</p>

<p>I asked General Botha why he did not concentrate
all the forces in the field, so that he could make
some decided stands. He answered: “We have
talked the matter well over, and have made a definite
form of campaign for the remaining portion of
the war. Should we gather all our fighting men
together into one force we could undoubtedly make
some very pretty fights; but there would be only
a few of them, for with the overwhelming force
against us they could soon surround any position
we could take, and there would be an end to our
cause. As it is, we will split up into four or five
commands, continue operations independently of
each other, but keep absolutely in touch, and confer
on the general plan of campaign at all times. It
took your colonial troops seven years of that sort
of work to gain independence against the same
country, and we can do the same thing. We
can fight seven years without being crushed, and
should we gain our independence at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of that time we would consider the time well
spent.”</p>

<p>General Botha pointed to the facts that his troops
were in better condition and had greater resources
than Washington’s ever had; that there was more
accord among his burghers than there was among
the American colonial troops; and that, more important
still, the entire population of the country
was in absolute sympathy with the cause. This
shows why a campaign can develop into what the
British call guerrilla warfare and still be a part of a
splendid strategical plan. In my mind, the operations
in South Africa cannot be called guerrilla warfare
so long as the Boer commands of 3,000 or
4,000 men move on regular marches, with heavy
and light artillery, baggage-trains, and assisted by
signal corps. From these commands small detachments
are sent out for the various duties of blowing
up a bridge or a culvert, attacking a force sufficiently
small in number, or capturing a supply
train. All of these operations are done under a
system of regular order, and are not, as the British
reports would lead us to believe, the work of mere
bands of robbers or outlaws.</p>

<p>The strategy shown in these movements, and, in
the main, the tactics and their execution, have
been of a superlative order, although not developed
from military text-books, but rather from the natural
brain of a lion-hunter. It is to be regretted
that more of the movements have not been
chronicled, so that the military world might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
have been benefited by a study of these operations.</p>

<p>The facts that at last the British overwhelmed the
Boers with their inexhaustible supplies of troops,
and that the general strategy of the campaign
proved successful, do not justify their careless
tactics in the routine of the campaign. If matched
against a larger and more aggressive army than
that of the Boers, this characteristic carelessness
might have been very fatal.</p>

<p>Here is a curious instance of this inexplicable
heedlessness. The first important engagement after
the occupation of Pretoria was the battle of Diamond
Hill, about sixteen miles north of the capital, and
it was fought by Lieutenant-General French, who
commanded the cavalry division. His command
had been very much weakened by drafts upon it for
duty about army headquarters in Pretoria, so that
he did not have more than 3,000 men at his call.
This cavalry command, with a few guns, went out
to ascertain the position taken by the retreating
burghers. They found them strongly entrenched
on a range of hills commanding the valley through
which the British were to advance. The battle
lasted three days, the fighting going on all that
time. General French told me, on the third night,
when we were at dinner, that it had been the hardest
fight he had had during the campaign, and that
he doubted whether he could hold the position
until noon the next day, when Lord Roberts had
promised him reënforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
General French was surrounded on three sides
with what he said was an overwhelming force of the
enemy, <em>and yet he did not station any pickets or
outposts even on his headquarters camp</em>. Captain
Beech brought a wagon-train into the center of the
camp, through the lines, without so much as a challenge.
The bitter cold of the high veldt kept me
awake that night, and about three o’clock in the
morning I heard horsemen riding through the lines.
They took no especial care to keep their movements
secret, so I imagined them to be friends, but lay
waiting for the expected challenge. None came,
and the party of horse rode nearer and nearer until
it came quite up to General French’s headquarters,
near a little farmhouse. Dawn was just breaking,
and in the gray light I recognized Captain Beech as
he rode up to headquarters. Captain Beech is an
old campaigner in experience if not in years, and
such negligence of the most ordinary and primary
needs of campaigning seemed to him outrageous.
He expressed himself with highly-colored vehemence.</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, “the Boers could ride in
here and take the whole outfit, for there isn’t an
outpost on the camp; and you are the only one who
heard me coming on with a whole wagon-train.”</p>

<p>It staggers an American to comprehend such a
situation; and if the Boers had had a little energy
that night they might easily have taken the whole
command. It is an instinct of animals and birds to
have their pickets. When a herd of deer is grazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
on the plains, a few are always left on the outskirts
to watch for danger; when a flock of birds is feeding
on the ground, sentries are left in the trees; but
the ordinary British officer does not seem to share
that useful instinct. I asked one of General French’s
staff if it was the custom of all commands to ignore
the necessity of placing outposts, and he said:</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use? They never attack at
night.”</p>

<p>The fact that they do not make night attacks
and are not more keenly alive to such possibilities
does not justify the British neglect of outposts
and pickets. I have ridden in and out of
Pretoria at all times of day and night without once
being challenged, although it was well known at
headquarters that the residents of the town were
communicating with the Boer commanders every
day. A little Afrikander girl of sixteen told me as
a jolly joke that she had ridden out on her bicycle
to see her father, who had a command in the hills
within five miles of the center of Pretoria. She
said that she rode part of the way with a mounted
picket, with whom she chatted as they rode along.
An order was issued by the military governor that
every one who wished to ride a bicycle or a horse,
or to drive in a carriage, must get a permit to do
so; and the fair young patriot said that after this
it was easier than ever, for she used the permit as a
pass, and none of the Tommies ever knew the
difference.</p>

<p>The conclusion of my observations is that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
every-day tactics the British officer still commits
the radical error of taking too much for granted.
This is almost a racial error, for it has always been
his besetting sin to despise his foe and to be surprised
by clever tricks. Herein he is thoroughly
unlike the American officer, as well as unlike his
own allies from Canada and Australia. The nimble
wit of the newer countries and the expert training
of the West Pointer lead both Americans and colonials
to keep thinking what the enemy may be
doing and to take no bravado chances.</p>

<p>After these criticisms of certain features of British
tactics it is a pleasure to recall a piece of work
by the Royal Horse Artillery on the last day of that
battle, which would win the respect and admiration
of every American soldier. Diamond Hill is a
very high kopje, rising directly out of a plain, and
from the beginning of the rise it is fully half a mile
to the summit, the latter part of the ascent being
very steep. The sides of the kopje are covered
with huge rocks, some of them ten feet high, and
standing in every conceivable position, just as they
rested at the time of a great upheaval that broke
the earth’s strata. It was almost impossible to
walk over the rocks, they were so rough and jagged,
yet the officers and men of this battery brought
their guns to the very top of the kopje and commanded
the entire valley. It was a magnificent
thing to do, and almost incredible; I never before
saw soldiers bring to pass such an apparently impossible
attempt. But it evidently was not an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
achievement in that campaign of titanic labors, for
it occasioned no comment.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better illustration can be given of the
new military conditions which modern strategy and
tactics have to meet than a picture that shows
how an actual battlefield looks. During the third
day the fighting had been very severe, and in one
place in the line the British had been compelled
to charge a position several times in order to prevent
being completely surrounded. There were
eight Maxim one-pounder machine guns, several
Colts’ machine guns, and a large number of heavy
guns in action during the entire day, and at one
time they were all concentrated at one point. I
took a photograph, which shows better than anything
else how modern warfare has lost all picturesque
features. This picture shows nothing but
a placid landscape that might have been taken
on any farm, instead of which thousands of men
were fighting desperately. At the time the photograph
was taken there was a charge going on, but
the khaki clothing makes the men invisible to the
camera. Bullets were singing across the plain like
sheets of rain, and shells were screeching overhead;
along the ridge there was a constant crackling of
small arms; but the landscape itself was as quiet as
that of a New England farm.</p>

</div>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">The</span> most important work of an army
is that of the commissary department,
which is the one division
of labor that receives the least
credit and no glory. An army
might get along without its engineer
corps, or its signal service;
it could at least march
without guns; but it cannot
move a foot without its full
supply of food.</p>

<p>A few days before Santiago
fell, General Shafter wired
the War Department that he
thought it likely he would
be compelled to withdraw. The despatch was
made public in the press; to withdraw meant a
retreat, and instantly a wave of indignation arose
against General Shafter. He was blamed for
being weak; he was blamed for allowing himself
to be drawn into a trap; he was blamed for
everything that the criticising public could think
of in their resentment. That the American army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
should retreat was maddening to the people, for
they could see no reason for such action, except
the power of the enemy against them. It was not
the enemy, however, that threatened to drive the
Fifth Army Corps back, nor was it the weakness of
the commanding general—it was a rain storm. The
columns had pushed forward toward Santiago as
fast as possible, and so long as the line of communication
between the front and the base of supplies
at Siboney was open all went well. But suddenly
it rained, and then all was different. The road was
eight miles of swimming mud, flanked by impossible
jungle; a wheel could not turn in it, and the pack
animals could flounder through it but slowly. Hence
the supply of rations at the front began to dwindle
away, and General Shafter decided that he must
move his army toward the food supply, as the food
supply could not move toward the army.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts was confronted by the same difficulty
in South Africa, and he met it in a masterly
manner. The army supply corps that handles the
commissary department has been a marvel of efficiency.
The work of supplying the British army
in the field in South Africa has been done much
better than the same work was done by the American
force at Tampa or in Cuba; and had it not been
for the brilliant management of Colonel (later General)
John F. Weston, who was in command at the
base of supplies, General Shafter would certainly
have been compelled to withdraw from the positions
that had been won after hard-fought battles. Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Weston ignored all forms of the regular routine;
his one object was to feed the men on the fighting
line, and feed them he did.</p>

<p>One day I heard one of his officers complaining
that he could not get some of his papers receipted,
showing a delivery of rations to a certain brigade,
and Weston answered, in a characteristic manner,
“Damn the receipts! You give rations to anybody
who wants them, and after it’s all over I’ll
receipt for the whole bunch; and if the government
doesn’t like it the government can have me—but
the men won’t go hungry.”</p>

<p>Every time I had an opportunity of going to the
supply depot I secured all the tobacco I could buy
to give to the men at the front. It was an article
worth more than its weight in gold, and there was
no greater pleasure than to have the chance of
making some of the men happy. There was a regulation
against allowing one person to purchase
more than a pound of tobacco at one time. I asked
permission of Colonel Weston to be allowed to buy
more; but he was loth to sell it to me until I explained
that I did not use it myself, but wanted it
for the men. After my explanation he would not
sell it at all, but gave me all I could carry. During
this time the government held his receipt for all this
tobacco, and it really was equivalent to so much
money. Colonel Weston’s contempt for governmental
red tape saved hundreds of lives in the Santiago
campaign; and instead of asking for an
accounting for the lack of receipts, the Washington<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
government made him the head of the subsistence
department, where he has done the best work in
rationing our army at home and in our island possessions
that has ever been known.</p>

<p>Before the change in the head of the commissary
department was made, things were not so well done.
We cannot do better than to look toward England
for some valuable points in the conduct of this
department, especially in the matter of army supplies
for the warmer or tropical countries. They
have had more experience than we in feeding their
forces on foreign service, and consequently they
have brought the business to a state that borders
on perfection. In strategy, fighting, and the movement
of troops they have been found lacking; but
one of the things they have done well is the feeding
of their men.</p>

<p>It is a colossal business to supply over 200,000
healthy men, with field and mountain appetites,
when they are 7,000 miles away from home, and
where there is an active enemy seeking to destroy
their communications. It would be a great task to
feed that number of men at home, where there is
no difficulty in transportation; but when a month’s
time must be occupied for the delivery of the food
stuffs, the problem becomes most serious.</p>

<div id="i_151" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 34.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="548" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Camp of a transport train in General French’s supply column.</div></div>

<p>The quartermaster’s department of the British
army has to provide the rations for the men and
forage for the animals; besides this, it is called upon
to furnish the transportation of the food stuffs, as
well as of the army itself. The paymaster’s work is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
also included in this department. After the quartermaster’s
department has put the supplies on the
ground, it falls to the lot of the Army Service
Corps to deliver it to the various commands in the
field.</p>

<p>The Army Service Corps is one of the features of
the British army which American authorities would
do well to study. It is an armed and drilled commissary
corps, of about 4,000 officers and men,
which handles the entire work of that branch; but
it is a fighting corps as well, when occasion requires.
This last feature is of great value, in that it does
away with the necessity of a detachment of men
being drawn off as a special guard for every wagon
or two. The Army Service Corps acts as its own
convoy where only an ordinary one is required.
When on home duty, it presents a spirited appearance,
with a military aspect fully equal to that of
the artillery. Its wagons and mounts are of the
same type as those of the artillery, and its general
equipment is similar.</p>

<p>This corps is one of the few departments that has
done well its entire duty during the South African
campaign. The reason is obvious—there was no
theory regarding the appetite of a robust soldier;
it was a solemn fact, just as evident at Aldershot or
on Salisbury Plain as in the field. It has been just
as real in Egypt or India during the past years of
peace as at the present moment at the Cape. The
British soldier ate as heartily when he was fighting
fanatic dervishes as when he fights the Boer; consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
that department was not compelled on
the field to test antiquated methods or to experiment
with new theories, only to find them wrong.</p>

<p>The system that England works upon is the establishment
of a base of supplies at home, situated
at Woolwich, where the government supply depot
was established for the especial purpose of meeting
the demand of an emergency in case of war. At
this depot supplies have been kept ready for shipment
to the front at a moment’s notice. They are
all packed in cases, the heaviest of which weigh one
hundred pounds, while the majority weigh from
thirty to eighty pounds. These cases are of convenient
size for rapid transportation in the field, and
they are so packed that it is not necessary to open
them until they are issued to the consumers.</p>

<p>Cape Town was made the secondary, or field base,
where all supplies are shipped as fast as they can be
loaded on ships; and it is necessary to keep an
extra supply of rations and forage sufficient for the
consumption of every man and animal on the field
for three months, at least, and as much more as it
is possible to accumulate above the amount used.
Should this reserve stock be called upon, the men
would be put on shorter rations until it was an assured
fact that the delay in the arrival of fresh supplies
was overcome.</p>

<p>The reserve stock consists of 5,000 tons of canned
beef, 5,000 tons of white flour, 5,000 tons of hard
bread, 90 tons of coffee, 50 tons of tea, 780 tons of
sugar, 150 tons of salt, 10 tons of pepper, 1,500<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
tons of jam, 500,000 gallons of rum, 40,000 tons of
oats, 40,000 tons of corn and bran, 40,000 tons of
hay. None of this may be used unless it is absolutely
necessary and all other supplies fail. Besides
this supply at the Cape, an intermediate depot was
established at de Aar junction, which is about half
way to Pretoria; others were at Bloemfontein and
Johannesburg, and the last one was established at
Pretoria.</p>

<p>My first idea when looking through these supply
stations was of the huge part America played in
the South African war. One might well imagine
he was in the commissary department of the United
States army, as nearly all the supplies bear the mark
of American production. While I was at the German
army manœuvres I observed the same thing—American
farmers were keeping the German army
alive; and my first sight of anything that pertained
to war in the South African struggle was a great
pile of cases of the familiar Chicago canned beef,
such as we used in Cuba, on the wharf at Baira, in
Portuguese South Africa. I think the English army
could be trailed from Cape Town to Middleburg by
empty cans of what they call “bully beef,” each
one with the Chicago or Kansas City label.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know America was so large,” said an
officer to me one day, “until I saw so much tinned
meat down here.”</p>

<p>That same “tinned meat” from Chicago will do
more to command the respect of every European
nation towards the United States than all the battleships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
we can float. They have realized what it
would mean to attempt to feed an army without the
assistance of America.</p>

<div id="i_155" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="352" height="93" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A base of supplies at de Aar Junction.</div></div>

<p>Many shiploads of supplies came directly from
American ports to the Cape, not only of food stuffs,
but also of horses, mules, and cattle. It involves
more to supply the animals of an army than to feed
the men themselves, for the quantity that is used by
a mule, horse, or ox is much greater than that
required by a man. Each horse has to be given
twelve pounds of hay, twelve pounds of oats, and a
pound of bran every day. The mules receive ten
pounds of oats, six pounds of hay, and one pound
of bran. The oxen are usually turned out to graze,
and find sufficient food in the veldt grass; when that
is not abundant, they receive about eight pounds of
hay, but no grain. A large amount of “mealies,” as
American corn is called, is used in lieu of oats or
other grain, although in many cases the horses will
not eat it, being unaccustomed to it. It is always
best to feed the animals on the product of the
country from which they come, if possible, as they
do not understand and will not eat strange grain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The native pony which I rode in South Africa would
not touch the plentiful oats, although at one time
he was without proper forage for several days.</p>

<p>The use of spirituous liquors has been established
in the British army many years, and the issuance is
still carried on in the same manner that it was years
ago. I do not think there is as much tobacco used
in the British army as in ours, although I have
nothing but personal observation to judge by in the
supposition; but the Britisher wants his “grog”
in the army quite the same as in the navy. The
issue is about half a gill of rum per day. The quality
used is of the very best known, and it comes
from a stock bought by the government in Jamaica
about forty years ago. The last of that old supply
is now being used. The use of liquor as a part of
the ration in the British army is almost as old as the
army itself, and although it has been fought by the
prohibitionists for several years, it still continues.
There is not enough issued to cause any intoxication,
and the use of the amount which the men receive
undoubtedly works effectively against drinking
to excess. A man naturally wants what he cannot
have, and if he is denied the use of liquor he immediately
craves it, and to satisfy that craving he
takes too much. While in the field or at Cape
Town I saw but one soldier under the influence of
liquor; this occurred in Pretoria on the day of the
formal occupation; he had celebrated the event too
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>There has been a great outcry in the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
States against the army “canteen” as having a bad
influence over the soldier. If the people who rail at
this establishment will look at it in a proper light
they will see that instead of increasing drunkenness
it has a direct tendency to decrease it. Some men
drink to excess whenever they get a chance, and
such men always will do this, for alcoholism is a
disease, and its victims will always find the opportunity
to get drink. Others are quite satisfied with
a single drink; but they want that one, and they
will have it. If they cannot find it at the post they
will go where they can obtain it, and that means
in some saloon, where the temptation to take more
is far greater than at their own canteen. Not
only is the desire less in the post canteen, but
should a man become intoxicated in the least degree
no more would be served him; while if he were in a
public house he might keep on drinking as long as
he could stand up against the bar, or as long as his
money held out.</p>

<p>In the British army the use of large quantities of
jam is supposed to prevent, to a degree, the craving
for liquor, and consequently it is issued to the men
regularly. Tea is also a part of the British ration
that is never used in the American army, as our
men do not want it. The American soldier laughs
when he hears of British troops in the field being
served with afternoon tea; but its use is so universal
in the British Empire that the men crave it as
our men crave coffee.</p>

<p>The British soldier in the field is better fed than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the American, and he has more variety; but to
obtain that variety of food costs time, and in consequence
the troops move much slower than ours do.</p>

<p>The rations of the South African army were in
marked contrast to those of the Fifth Army Corps
during the Santiago campaign. We got bacon, hard
bread, and coffee, and very seldom anything else.
Occasionally tomatoes in cans were issued to us, and
sometimes sugar; but the three staple articles just
mentioned were all we were sure of, and all we
wanted. The volunteers suffered somewhat, because
they did not know how to cook these simple rations
so as to make them acceptable; but the regular,
who had lived on them many times in the West,
was satisfied and asked nothing more. The tomatoes
were issued in gallon cans, and naturally were
exceedingly difficult to carry if the regiment was
moving rapidly.</p>

<p>I recall that on the day when the battle of Guasimas
opened, General McKibbin’s brigade was encamped
near Siboney, and we were ordered to go
into action on General Young’s right, as it was
known the enemy was in front of us in force, and
it looked as though a general battle would ensue.
The brigade was ordered on the road just as some
rations had been issued, and in the issue were these
large cans of tomatoes. The men could not carry
them, and so were compelled to abandon them. I
waited until the regiments had moved out, and then
watched a crowd of Cuban “soldiers” gathering up
the cans, as well as a lot of blankets that some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the men had thrown away. I allowed the Cubans
to gather a goodly lot, and then ordered them to
carry the stuff on the march forward, and later in
the day, when the regiments had halted, our men
got their rations back. It is almost useless to issue
food in large packages to men on the march, for
they cannot possibly carry them, and the food is
wasted. It is not the custom of our commissary
department to do this, but for that Cuban campaign
the government bought all the food supplies that
could be found, regardless of the covering.</p>

<p>The further task of putting rations on the firing
line, or at the extreme front, is a prodigious difficulty.
The railroad is used as far as possible, and
then wagons and pack animals are brought into play.
In South Africa the transportation was exceedingly
crude. All sorts of wagons and carts were brought
into service; everything that rolled on wheels was
promptly commandeered. Ox-wagons, buckboards,
Cape carts, grocery wagons, and even private carriages
were a part of the long line of vehicles. The
ox-carts and great trek-wagons were chiefly used
for commissary supplies, but they were so heavy
as to be unsuitable for the work. An ox-cart was
drawn by a span of sixteen or twenty animals, while
the army wagon was drawn by ten mules. This
was almost twice the number necessary, and the
superfluous stock greatly delayed the operations, for
it could not carry much more than its own feed.
Those mules were much smaller than our big army
mules, but six would have been ample for any ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
load. When more are used, there is a great
amount of energy lost. Pack-mules were almost
unknown, and they are never used in South Africa
as they are always used in the army of the United
States. One of our trains of forty mules can carry
much more than forty mules can pull, and with far
greater ease. The pack-train, moreover, can go
anywhere, over any sort of roads or treks, even
into the firing line itself, with rations or ammunition;
while a wagon must have a good road or it
will be compelled to turn back.</p>

<p>In our trains the mules are not bridled, but are
taught to follow the lead of a “bell-horse,” an
animal with a bell around its neck, and either led
or ridden by one of the packers. Wherever that
bell goes, the other mules will follow, regardless of
obstructions or anything else. In my judgment,
nothing can compare with the pack-mule for transportation
in the field. Wagons are useful as long
as there are good, hard roads to follow; but enemies
have an unpleasant way of going away from
the roads into hills and mountains, or across trackless
plains, and there is where the mule is not merely
valuable, but absolutely essential. These pack animals
can keep up, not only with the infantry, but
also with fast-moving bodies of mounted troops.
The “packers” of the American army are civilian
<i>attachés</i>, but they are a very essential part of the
force. They are nearly all men from the West, and
are generally of the cow-puncher stamp, afraid of
nothing, not even of work. These packers did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
some of the most heroic work during the Santiago
campaign, although they never got any
credit for it, and are seldom mentioned in despatches.
They are to the army what the stokers
are to the navy—the very means of life; yet
bound to go on doing that hard, undistinguished
work, with no applause from the great unthinking
public. They are never seen in parades and
reviews, yet to them belongs a great portion of
the credit for these displays. The packers of the
army are accustomed to go into the very firing line
to deliver ammunition. It is indeed a memorable
sight to witness these men in action, and to watch
their indifference to the danger that is singing about
their heads. Very picturesque are these Western
packers, with their happy abandon and their oblivion
to worry. They wear no uniform, they have no
regiment to be proud of; they are just plain, good-natured,
hard-working civilians of the great West.
The only arms they carry are their own Colts, just
as they carried them in New Mexico or Montana.</p>

<p>One day, when the fighting was at its height in
front of Santiago, a pack-train came up to the line
with a welcome supply of rations and ammunition;
and after the boxes had been dumped on the
ground, and the men were prying the lids off with
their bayonets, one of the packers strolled up to
the trenches and drawled, “I ain’t had a crack at
a greaser since I left the reservation, so here goes.”
He stepped out on the embankment, in full view of
the enemy, and emptied his six-shooter towards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
little low city in front of us. As the Spanish
trenches at this point were fully a quarter of a mile
away, his pistol did not produce a panic among
them, but he enjoyed his prank.</p>

<div id="i_162" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="344" height="260" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">An improvised commissariat cart in South
Africa.</div></div>

<p>“Well, I reckon I must have got four out o’ that
six,” he remarked, as he began to reload.</p>

<p>“You’d better come down out of that, or one of
the other two will get you,” called a soldier.</p>

<p>“Get me!” he said contemptuously; “I never
see a greaser yet that could hit a bunch o’ steers in
a corral.”</p>

<p>He was becoming the target of the entire Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
line, and drawing their fire; so an officer ordered
him to get down, and told him at the same time
that if he wanted to shoot he might borrow a
rifle.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “I ain’t got no time to
monkey ‘round here, for I got to get some grub up,
or you-all don’t eat.” And off he went, telling
the other packers how he had “done up half a
dozen greasers.”</p>

<p>If the British army had had a goodly number of
Kentucky mules, the big sixteen-hands sort, instead
of the little donkey wagons they did have, they
would have saved several months of their campaigning.
One of those big mules can carry all day as
heavy a load as he can stand under; then if you
remove the pack-saddle and let him have a roll, he
is fresh enough to keep going all night. Not only
are they equal to heavy loads and long hours, but
they can go longer than a horse without forage.</p>

<p>The British army has an emergency ration that is
said to be very useful in case of extreme need.
Each man and officer carries one in his haversack,
and the men are not allowed to open them, except
by order of an officer, or in case of absolute need
when no officer is near. This emergency ration consists
of a tin can, shaped something like a pocket-book,
five inches long, two and a half inches wide,
and an inch and a half thick. It is divided into two
compartments, one containing four ounces of concentrated
beef, known as pemmican. The whole
weighs about twelve ounces, and the label on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
case informs the soldier that the ration is calculated
to maintain strength for thirty-six hours if eaten in
small quantities at a time. I never ate one of them,
but I have heard some of those who have say that
they could eat half a dozen of them and still feel
empty. They do not satisfy hunger, but merely
sustain strength.</p>

<p>Another ration, prepared by a firm in England,
consists of a species of stew of beef, potatoes, carrots,
and gravy; it makes an exceedingly good
dinner, one can being sufficient for two men for one
meal. It may be heated easily in the can in a few
moments, as it is already cooked, and it could, if
occasion demanded, be eaten cold. General Weston
has been sending a similar ration to the soldiers in
the Philippines, put up in convenient shape, with
rounded corners to the can so that it may be carried
in the pocket.</p>

<p>In many respects the usual rations of the British
and American armies are very similar, but the latter
army uses much more bacon than the former, which
uses much more fresh beef.</p>

<p>The British military authorities always study out
a ration for a particular campaign, and then issue
it according to the different climates and zones.
Major Louis L. Seamen, who has seen a great deal
of military service in every part of the world, has
devoted much study to this subject, and he claims
that there is nothing more important in army
subsistence than this adapting the ration to the
temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The ration adopted for the campaign in South
Africa is:</p>

<p class="in0 smaller">
1 lb. canned meat.<br />
4 oz. bacon, as a change from meat.<br />
2 oz. cheese.<br />
1 lb. hardtack instead of 1-1/4 lb. bread.<br />
1 oz. chocolate instead of tea or coffee.<br />
1/2 oz. coffee, 1/4 oz. tea.<br />
3 oz. sugar, 1/2 oz. salt, 1/3 oz. pepper.<br />

</p>

<p>The ration of the United States army is:</p>

<p class="in0 smaller">
20 oz. fresh beef or mutton.<br />
12 oz. pork or bacon.<br />
22 oz. salt meat, when no fresh meat is issued.<br />
14 oz. dried fish, when no fresh meat is issued.<br />
18 oz. pickled or fresh fish instead of fresh meat.<br />
18 oz. soft bread, or<br />

</p>

<p>The American army also has what is called a
travel ration, issued on any transportation where it
is impossible to cook more than coffee. It is also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
often used on quick marches, as it is a short but
sufficient allowance. It consists of:</p>

<p class="in0 smaller">
1 lb. hard bread.<br />
3/4 lb. canned beef.<br />
1/3 lb. baked beans or tomatoes (canned).<br />
1/8 lb. coffee.<br />
1/15 lb. sugar.
</p>

<p>It was this ration that we used throughout the
Santiago campaign, save that most of the time we
had bacon, instead of canned beef, and we very
seldom got the beans or tomatoes. I found it
adequate for the entire time, even with all the hard
work we went through. No one found fault with it,
except some of the volunteers, and they were dissatisfied
with the ration because they did not understand
how to use it to advantage. A regular soldier
can make about fourteen distinct dishes with that
ration, each one very palatable.</p>

<p>There was considerable trouble over the complaints
raised by the volunteers, and it developed
into the “meat scandal” that has furnished jests
for the comic papers ever since; but these difficulties
are bound to appear in every campaign. I did
see some meat in Cuba that was not fit to eat; but,
on the whole, the meat supply was very good when
one considers the haste in which it was purchased
and the climate where it was used.</p>

<p>England has had her difficulties in the same form,
but her people do not make such an outcry as was
raised in our newspapers. Early in the South
African war the troop-ship <i>Arawa</i> sailed from
Southampton, and before she got to sea it was discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
that her cargo of meat was spoiled. She
put back, and the entire lot, amounting to fifteen
thousand pounds of English and colonial beef and
mutton, was dumped out on the dock—a “very
unwholesome mess.” The mutton was green, and
in a bad condition; as soon as the port health
officer saw it he ordered it to be taken to sea
and dumped, which was promptly done. Had
this occurred in America during the Spanish war
the newspapers would probably have demanded the
instant removal of a few officials. In England,
however, the only comment in the papers was that
“the incident was the one topic of conversation at
the docks yesterday, and military men were highly
indignant about it.”</p>

<p>Before closing the subject of rations it is necessary
to speak of the commissary department of the
Boer forces, if I may use this phrase regarding a
department that does not exist. Among the Boers
each man is his own supply corps, finding his
rations wherever he can, and in what quantity he
can. It is marvelous what a small amount these
burghers can subsist upon while carrying on active
operations. During an action near Pretoria I was
lying on top of a kopje, watching the advance of the
British forces, while they kept up a heavy shell fire.
About one o’clock I felt hungry, so I opened my
haversack and took out a loaf of bread and a piece
of beef weighing perhaps a couple of pounds.
Near me was an old, white-bearded Boer, who must
have been at least seventy-five. After I had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
eating for a few moments I noticed that he had no
haversack, and so asked him if he would not have a
bit of the bread.</p>

<p>“Have you plenty?” he asked before accepting.</p>

<p>I said that I had, so he took the loaf and broke
off a very small piece, handing the remaining portion
back. I told him that he might keep it all, and
also gave him some meat. As soon as he had assured
himself that I had more, he called to a couple
of boys near by, and they came over, accompanied
by other boys. He divided the loaf and meat, and it
served for the full day’s rations for five fighting men.</p>

<p>“I had some bread yesterday,” said the old man,
half apologetically, “but I have not had time to
get any to-day.”</p>

<p>“Will you have a drink?” I inquired, as I unslung
my canteen.</p>

<p>“Water?” he queried, as though afraid I was
going to offer him something stronger.</p>

<p>The British people at home have taken comfort
in assuming that, as no supplies can get to the Boers,
the war will be brought to a speedy end. Deluded
people! So long as there is a trek-ox and a sack of
mealies in the Transvaal the Boers will be sufficiently
supplied to carry on the war. They carry
no store wagons, they issue no rations; but occasionally
an ox is slaughtered, and each man hangs
up a piece of the beef until it is dried. He sticks
that into his pocket, with some bread made of corn,
if he cannot get better, and he is perfectly content.</p>

<p>I asked General de la Rey where he expected to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
his supplies after he left Pretoria, and he remarked
quietly, as if without humorous intention, “Oh, the
English are bringing in enough for both armies.”</p>

<div id="i_169" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_169.jpg" width="353" height="264" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A soldier with three months’ provisions.</div></div>

<p>He had warrant, too; for I know of many cases
where, as the supplies of a command were getting
low, they went out and captured a wagon-train or a
supply-train on the railroad, and replenished their
larders. General de Wet has kept his commands
for many months in rations, clothing, and other
necessaries of war from the supplies of the enemy.</p>

<p>When the Boers went into a town, they never
commandeered anything without paying cash for it,
and in this matter they were far too lenient. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
sitting in the Transvaal Hotel in Pretoria one evening
when a command of about forty men rode up.
The commandant came into the office and asked
the proprietor if he would give the men a meal;
they had been marching since early morning without
anything to eat. The man in charge (the proprietor,
being an Englishman, had fled at the beginning
of the war) asked if they could pay for the
entertainment. The officer replied that they did
not have enough money to pay the regular price,
but that he would give all they had and would pay
the rest later. The hotel man told him roughly
that he was not running his place for fun, and that he
could not feed the soldiers unless paid in advance.
The commandant walked slowly out and told his
burghers what had been said, and they wheeled their
horses about and continued their march through
the town, supperless. I do not believe there is
another people on earth that would have done the
same thing, and allowed that money-grasping hotel
man to go on serving meals to men who were too
cowardly to fight for their country, or to foreigners
who had deserted their cause, but who happened to
have enough money to satisfy his exorbitant demands.</p>

<p>Many of the burghers went out of Pretoria on the
last days with scarcely enough to keep them alive,
simply because they had no money, and they would
not take by force even a portion of the stores piled
high in every shop. The forbearance of these simple
people was almost past belief.</p>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">Railways</span> are undoubtedly one of
the most important factors in
the wars of to-day, and after
some campaigning my first idea
of war is a railroad for a guide.
Day after day the advancing
columns follow the broken iron
pathway with the twisted rails
and wrecked bridges as signs on
the trail they are following. At
the same time the retreating
force rolls comfortably along in
well-working trains, blowing up
everything behind them as soon
as they are ready to evacuate a
position.</p>

<p>After returning from South Africa I spent much
time reading in the London press of the various
engagements that I had seen, or had learned about
from those who had seen them. Nearly every despatch
said that “the enemy was completely demoralized,”
or “the enemy retreated in wild confusion.”
As a matter of fact, there was at no time any confusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
whatever on the part of the Boers, and the
retreats were the most orderly and methodical affairs
that can be imagined. If there was no railway for
use, the men merely mounted their horses and rode
away as though there were no really pressing reason
for their going and that any time would do. Even
when the British advance was within striking distance,
the same calmness was displayed. When
there was a railway communication, which was generally
the case, trains were brought up, and the
burghers entrained their mounts and their guns;
and when everything was ready, they pulled out to
the next place selected for a stand. The women
occupied the first-class carriages, and if they did not
fill the seats, the men shared them; but the men
did not seem to feel much preference between a
passenger carriage and an open truck. It was always
an orderly, good-natured crowd, which apparently,
except for the Mauser slung across every shoulder,
might have been returning from a county fair.</p>

<p>The retreat from Pretoria was possibly an exception,
as there was then great excitement throughout
the city; but even in this case the agitation was
among the people of the city, and not among the
fighting men. They continued in their usual quiet,
indifferent manner, while many of the non-combatants
were almost panic-stricken. The commandoes
preferring to make the retreat towards Middleburg
by rail gathered at the station and attended to the
entraining of their mounts as though it were a
matter of no importance whether they got away or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
not; and yet at that time it was thought that the
British were but a few miles away.</p>

<p>To be able to control the railway means everything
to an army, especially when it is operating in
a hostile territory. All things must be sacrificed to
protect and maintain the line so as to allow the safe
transit of trains; and to that problem the British
were compelled to devote most of their attention;
the burghers sought chiefly to destroy their plans,
as they were not of sufficient force to control any
great portion of the railways.</p>

<p>The defense of railroads did not enter into the
Spanish-American War on either side, as the territory
covered by the operations in Cuba was too
small for them to be of vital importance; but owing
to the vast territory under military operation in
South Africa they have been a factor of prime importance.
If the Boer commanders had had less
respect for property, and had destroyed every piece
of rolling stock that they could not use, they would
have been more successful; but instead of that they
usually abandoned it all, and allowed the enemy to
take it, enabling him in every case to use it immediately
for the transportation of supplies and troops.
A torch would have prevented this many times, and
would have been the proper and legitimate method
to be used; but, thinking of the loss to some of their
own people, they allowed the British to take everything.
Some commandants even argued against
blowing up the bridges. The Spaniards knew the
value of the fire-brand at Daiquiri, for when General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Shafter’s army was preparing to land and begin
the advance on Santiago, the invaders on the transports
saw the thick smoke of the burning buildings
curling skywards; and when we landed, about two
hours later, we found the station and engine-house
a mass of smoking embers, surrounding the burned
ruins of every engine at that end of the line. Had
the Boers shown more inclination to do as the Spaniards
did in this instance, they would have been far
better off, and would not have left miles of railroad
and thousands of pieces of rolling stock with which
their enemies operated against them.</p>

<div id="i_174" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="345" height="213" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The old and the new military bridge at
Modder River.</div></div>

<p>The maintenance of the rail communication between
the base of supplies at Cape Town and the
head of the army was the most difficult problem
that the British were called upon to solve during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the South African War; and there was nothing more
essential to the successful operations of the troops
than the freedom of this line. It was the main artery
from the heart, through which the life-blood of the
army flowed, and to check it, even for a few hours,
meant suffering and hardship to the troops at the rail
terminus, while to break it for a week or more would
have caused ruin to all plans of offensive campaign.</p>

<p>The guard to protect this communication must
be strong enough at every point to repel any attempt
to destroy the line; and to maintain this guard
means the constant use of thousands of troops who
may never hear a shot fired, but who are more essential
to the success of the campaign than the
soldiers who are doing the actual fighting. If this
vigilance should be relaxed for an hour, one of their
enemies could do enough damage with a single
stick of dynamite to embarrass the troops very
seriously, perhaps cause a wreckage that would take a
hundred men a day to repair, even if it were merely
on the ordinary line; but if they should get at a
bridge the damage could not be repaired in a week.</p>

<p>As the burghers retreated before the British advance
they destroyed all the bridges on the lines of
retreat in a most effectual manner by the use of
high explosives, in many cases leaving hardly one
stone above another. On the line from Cape Town
to Pretoria the spans over the Orange, Riet, Modder,
Vet, Vaal, and Zand rivers, besides many others, were
destroyed, so that it took weeks to repair them;
and in all cases the British were compelled to build<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
deviations of the line going around the banks of the
rivers, and by gradual descent into the bed of the
river and then up the opposite bank. Nearly all
the river beds of the Orange Free State and the
Transvaal are very deep, with perpendicular sides.
Their depth is so great that it is quite impossible
to cross at any point except by the railway bridges
and the regular fords and drifts. One may ride
almost to the edge of the river before realizing that
there is a stream in the vicinity. The laborious
difficulty of spanning these deep gorge-like river cuts
makes it necessary that a large body of troops be
detailed to guard each bridge or line deviation. The
railways must be maintained or the advance must
withdraw.</p>

<p>There is a striking contrast between the methods
of our government and that of the various European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
powers in the treatment of practical problems regarding
the mobilization of troops in time of peace.
There is not a state of the Old World so small as to
be without its manœuvres, and as the great agency
the railroad facilities are carefully studied. It has
been a huge military oversight on the part of our
government to fail to provide for an occasional mobilization
of troops, and for their operation in the
field as one body. We have never had an army of
sufficient size to warrant any such manœuvres with
the regular force alone, but the National Guard
regiments should be included in this sort of work
just as the militia regiments of England are every
year made a part of the Aldershot manœuvres. It
has been argued that our distances are too great to
justify such an extensive plan of peaceful operations,
but that very reason should be the incentive
to our government to appropriate sufficient funds to
carry on the work. It would be a simple matter
indeed were the operations of our forces confined to
as small a territory as those of England, France, or
Germany; but when the sudden call of troops
means a mobilization from many quarters and a
journey of several days, to leave the problem to the
last moment before solving it is indeed a perilous
hazard and one that is incredibly irrational.</p>

<p>In France and Germany every goods carriage is
marked on the outside, showing the exact number
of men or horses that it will accommodate for military
transportation; every division of the railroad
accounts each day to the Minister of War for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
number of cars on the tracks that may be used for
military purposes. Such minuteness would be, of
course, an unnecessary extreme for this country;
but we do need a practical relation existing between
the War Department and the railroads, by which
the brains, as well as the stock, of the various systems
might be drafted at any hour into strict military
accountability. Moreover, we need a national
instruction for the National Guard. The States
should give to the War Department authority to
mobilize and temporarily control their militia in
time of peace; and then the Department should be
provided with means to mobilize both State and
Federal troops of a certain territory, making the
territory as large as possible, so that the number of
regiments would be sufficient to be of use in the instruction
regarding transportation. Such a mobilization
would be of most signal value, even though
the encampment lasted only the briefest time, as it
would enable the officers to become accustomed to
rail transportation.</p>

<p>Just before the war with Spain the First United
States Infantry was stationed at the Presidio in San
Francisco; and when war seemed inevitable, that
regiment was ordered to Tampa. It was the first
body of troops to be moved, and although no great
haste was necessary, there was considerable difficulty
in getting the command properly entrained.
This was due to no fault of the field officers; they
knew what should be done, but the staff department
did not understand the necessary office work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
which it entailed. When the men were finally put
on board, they found themselves in tourist day-coaches,
without any sleeping accommodations, although
they were to cross the continent. The time
occupied by the journey was longer than necessary,
because it was necessary to stop twice a day long
enough to give the men an opportunity to cook
rations. A portable cooking outfit, to be used in
an ordinary baggage or freight car, should be supplied
to each regiment; most of the stops could
then be avoided, the trip be made in nearly half the
time, and the comfort of the men would be greatly
increased.</p>

<p>Just such an apparatus was attached to a troop
and hospital train upon which I made the journey
from Pretoria to Cape Town, and it was quite a
successful arrangement, although it was merely an
improvised one. That was a journey of six to
eight days at that time, and as every delay meant
a certain block in the traffic, stoppages were out of
the question; but with this rolling kitchen those on
the train were supplied with hot rations. The floor
of the car was covered with thin sheet iron or zinc,
to prevent the car from catching fire, a large water
tank was fitted in one end, and next to it was a
water boiler of considerable capacity. The stove
was an ordinary house range made fast, and if,
owing to the motion of the train, it was not a complete
success, it is another illustration of the value
of preparedness before the very moment of need
arrives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
The carrying capacity of our railroads far exceeds
that of England or of any other European country;
our cars are larger and our engines more powerful.
With better facilities at command, the problem is
simple, but we need practice in the work. The
War Department already knows how many cars
each railroad carries, how many may be used for
military purposes, and just how many men and
horses they will accommodate; but a military use of
some of them should be made occasionally as an
essential manœuvre. The regular officers know at
least the ordinary management of trains for soldiers,
but that cannot be said of the officers of the militia
which is to be used in time of war, and they should
be fully instructed in these matters in time of peace.</p>

<p>Armored trains are little better than amusing
until the inside of them is spattered with the blood
of good men sacrificed to a theory. Then the
amusement ends and the court of inquiry begins.
The character of the country in South Africa is all
that could be desired for the use of armored trains,
especially in the Orange Free State, where the great
veldt makes a low horizon on all sides, and the
level country is broken only by an occasional kopje
rising unexpectedly from the great plain. An advance
can be made with as much safety over this
country as any that could be chosen, and yet an
armored train did not succeed at any time to an extent
that would make it advisable to continue its use.</p>

<div id="i_181" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="346" height="281" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Canadian transport at a difficult drift.</div></div>

<p>Several of these trains were fitted out in Cape
Town and at other points, and none lacked anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
in construction which could make them a
success. They consisted of an engine and two open
trucks, one in front and one behind, all very heavily
armored with sheet steel or iron, and in some cases
hung with chains and heavy ropes as an extra protection.
The trucks were loopholed for small arms,
and each train carried one or more machine guns.
The vitals of each engine were as well protected as
was possible, and the entire machine was painted
either khaki or battle-ship gray. As long as it was
safely guarded at Cape Town it was a remarkable
invention; but when it attempted an advance towards
the enemy’s country, the trouble began. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
keenest watch failed to discover a trace of any foe,
and mile after mile of track they put in their
rear without discovering a living being until they
concluded to retire. Back they went until suddenly
they came to a broken bit of track, a rail removed,
by which the train was brought to a sudden halt.
Then from hidden foemen poured a storm of shot
and shell. There were but two alternatives, death
or surrender.</p>

<div id="i_182" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.8125em;">

  <div class="caption">Cape carts with British officers’ personal luggage;
nearly every officer had one of these
carts.</div></div>

<p>All that is required to capture the invading train
is thus to allow it to pass quietly on, then to remove
a single rail or to place some ordinary obstruction
on the track, and wait for its return. A few instances
have occurred where the armored train has
escaped when flanked by columns of troops, but as
a rule it has proved thus far a useless and dangerous
experiment, usually resulting in the death or capture
of all on board.</p>

<p>No features of the campaign are more interesting
than the attempts to cut the lines of communication
or to blow up a bridge or a culvert, and one of
the most daring deeds of the South African War
was done by Major Burnham, the Californian who
acted as chief scout on Lord Roberts’s staff.</p>

<p>Major Burnham received his training in the
Apache country in the Southwest from those Indians
who are masters of the world in following a
trail or informing themselves as to the whereabouts
of their enemies. Twice was Burnham captured by
the Boers and twice he made his escape. In both
cases he was wounded, the last time seriously. He
worked night and day for the army with which he
had cast his lot, and when he was ready to leave for
home, he came away with a letter from the field
marshal, written with his own hand, in which he
stated that Major Burnham had done him greater
service than any other one man in South Africa.</p>

<p>When the advance of the British forces came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
within striking distance of Pretoria, Lord Roberts
found it necessary to have the line cut just east of
the town in order to prevent the retreat towards
Middleburg by rail. Burnham started to do it,
taking with him a small patrol of men for assistance.
They made a wide detour to avoid meeting any of
the commandoes, which were now moving in the
same direction. All went well with him until he
had gone half way around and was about to turn to
the north to find the culvert which he intended to
destroy, when he suddenly met a large commando
coming directly towards his party. A running fight
followed, in which his horse was hit, throwing him
heavily, and he was seriously injured. The rest of
the party escaped, but he was made a prisoner, and
not being able to walk, he was put into a wagon
under a guard of four men, two riding in front and
two behind. The vehicle was one of the large trek-wagons,
drawn by a span of sixteen oxen and driven
by a Kaffir boy, who divided his time between the
front seat of the wagon and walking beside the span.
Major Burnham had made up his mind to escape at
all hazards, and so until night he lay in the wagon
making plans. The moon was almost full, and the
night was so bright that the difficulties of an attempt
to escape were greatly increased. During the early
part of the night the Kaffir driver kept his position
on the front seat, thus preventing any experiments
by the captive. He was just considering an attack
on the black boy when something went wrong
with one of the leaders, and the boy jumped down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
to remedy it. Seizing the opportunity thus
afforded, Major Burnham climbed out over the seat,
down on the disselboom or tongue of the wagon,
on which he stretched himself flat between the oxen
of the first span, swung himself under the disselboom,
dropped into the road, and allowed the wagon
to pass over his body. As soon as it had passed he
rolled quickly over and over into the ditch, and lay
perfectly quiet while the rear guard passed by,
wholly unconscious that their prisoner had escaped.
The khaki uniform which Major Burnham wore
made this little bit of strategy possible, for had he
been in dark clothes his body would probably have
been seen by the guard, who rode along within
twenty-five feet of him.</p>

<p>As soon as the two Boer soldiers had passed to a
distance which allowed no chance of discovery, the
Californian picked his way up through the rocks to
the side of an adjacent kopje, where he remained
hidden for some hours. For a well man to have
accomplished this feat would perhaps have been a
simple matter, although it took a daring mind to
conceive it; but for a man in Major Burnham’s condition
to go through the mental strain and physical
torture of such an escape was a remarkable performance,
and it received its proper praise from both
Briton and Boer. There is no man living who so
admires true courage and pluck, or who so despises a
coward, as does this hardy farmer-fighter; nor does
he bear resentment towards a man who, like Major
Burnham, fought only for the love of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
After spending several hours among the rocks,
without food or water, and in the bitterly cold night
air of an African winter, the scout began to drag
himself towards the railroad to accomplish the task
he had first set out to do. Strangely enough, when
he was captured he was not searched, and he still
carried in his tunic a dynamite cartridge ready for
use. During the entire campaign Major Burnham
never carried arms of any sort, and when he was
taken, his captors, not seeing any weapons about
him, probably thought that he had nothing about
him of a dangerous character. For more than two
miles he dragged himself over the rocky veldt until
he finally reached the railroad, along which he
crawled until he found a culvert. Upon this he
placed the cartridge, with a fuse of a sufficient
length to allow him to crawl to a place of safety.
He destroyed the line, and accomplished the task he
undertook, although it nearly cost him his life. He
was picked up by a British patrol late that afternoon,
almost dead from exposure and the effects of his
wound, and was taken to the hospital, where he was
confined for a fortnight before he could even walk.</p>

  <div class="caption">Canadian transport at a difficult drift.</div></div>

<p>This achievement is one of many performed by
this same brave American during the war. Major
Burnham is without doubt an exceedingly clever man
on the trail; he does not know fear, and his one idea
is to accomplish his end. But that does not entirely
indicate the reason for his high place in the confidence
of Lord Roberts; it rather comes from the
fact that Englishmen know nothing of the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
arts of the men of the plains; and when a man
is able to tell them the number of cattle in a herd,
and the number of men guarding it, or the number
of men in a commando, and the condition of their
horses, merely by examining the ground over which
they have passed, they consider it little short of a
miracle. Neither the officer nor the private soldier has
had any of the training of the latent faculties which is
so thorough among the officers and men of our army.</p>

<p>The value of a stick of dynamite is sometimes
more precious than that of gold in war. As the
Transvaal is a mining country, great quantities of
this explosive were easily obtained, and, accordingly,
despite the heavy guard, the line of communication
was often broken; in fact, so frequently was the
railroad destroyed that Lord Roberts was heavily
embarrassed during his first month in Pretoria for
provision and forage for his troops. Hardly a day
passed without the line being cut at some point.
Finally, in the hope of preventing further interruption
of his railroad line, Lord Roberts issued the
following proclamation, the terms of which were
about as cruel as could be devised:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger"><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span></p>

<p>Whereas, small parties of raiders have recently
been doing wanton damage to public property in
the Orange River Colony and South African Republic
by destroying railway bridges and culverts, and
cutting the telegraph wires; and, whereas, such
damage cannot be done without the knowledge and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
connivance of the neighboring inhabitants and the
principal civil residents in the districts concerned;</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I, Frederick Sleigh, Baron Roberts
of Kandahar and Waterford, K.P., G.C.B.,
G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., V.C., Field Marshal, Commander-in-Chief
of Her Majesty’s Troops in South
Africa, warn the said inhabitants and principal civil
residents that, whenever public property is destroyed
or injured in the manner specified above, they will
be held responsible for aiding and abetting the
offenders. The houses in the vicinity of the place
where the damage is done will be burnt, and the
principal civil residents will be made prisoners of
war.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2"><span class="smcap">Roberts</span>,</span><br />
F. M.
</p></blockquote>

<p>A few days later it was followed by another proclamation,
even more harsh:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger"><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span></p>

<p>Referring to my proclamation dated Pretoria,
16th June, 1900, I, Frederick Sleigh, Baron Roberts
of Kandahar and Waterford, K.P., G.C.B.,
G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., V.C., Field Marshal, Commander-in-Chief
of Her Majesty’s Troops in South
Africa, do hereby declare, proclaim, and make
known that, should any damage be done to any of
the lines of railway, or to any of the railway bridges,
culverts, or buildings, or to any telegraph lines or
other railway or public property in the Orange
River Colony, or in that portion of the South
African Republic for the time being within the
sphere of my military operations, the following
punishment will be inflicted:</p>

<p>1. The principal residents of the towns and district<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
will be held, jointly and severally, responsible
for the amount of damage done in their district.</p>

<p>2. In addition to the payment of the damage
above mentioned, a penalty depending upon the
circumstances of each case, but which in no event
will be less than a sum of 2s. 6d. per morgen on the
area of each farm, will be levied and recovered from
each burgher of the district in which the damage is
done, in respect of the land owned or occupied by
him in such district. Furthermore, all receipts for
goods requisitioned in such district on behalf of the
military authorities will be cancelled, and no payment
whatsoever will be made in respect of the same.</p>

<p>3. As a further precautionary measure, the Director
of Military Railways has been authorized to
order that one or more of the residents, who will
be selected by him from each district, shall from
time to time personally accompany the trains while
travelling through their district.</p>

<p>4. The houses and farms in the vicinity of the
place where the damage is done will be destroyed,
and the residents of the neighborhood dealt with
under martial law.</p>

<p>5. The military authorities will render every facility
to the principal residents to enable them to
communicate the purport of this proclamation to
the other residents in their district, so that all persons
may become fully cognizant of the responsibility
resting upon them.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">(Signed) <span class="in2"><span class="smcap">Roberts</span>,</span></span><br />
F. M., Commander-in-Chief,<br />
South Africa.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I say these proclamations were cruel, because they
struck the innocent for the doings of the guilty.
War is essentially merciless, but these orders made it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
unnecessarily infernal. The reason given for the
burning of farms near where the line was cut was
that such work could not have been done without
the knowledge of those who lived in the vicinity;
but that reason was wholly untrue, for in some cases
farms were burned and destroyed several miles away
from the railroad—in fact, not even in sight. How
could it be expected that the occupants of a farm
several miles away could know what was going on
while they slept? I know of cases where the same
damage has been done to the railroad under the
very noses of British sentries put there to prevent
it, and yet Lord Roberts assumed that the occupants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of the farmhouses must know all that went
on for miles about. On the majority of the farms
there were only women. They and hundreds of
other innocent people who had no hand in the railway
destruction, although their hearts were undoubtedly
with the cause, were made homeless by
the torch.</p>

Station.</div></div>

<p>The drastic measures taken by the British have
reacted against them. One of the principal obstacles
in the way of ending the war has been that the
homes and farms of the greater number of the
burghers in the field were destroyed, and there was
nothing left for them to do but to fight. Outside
of this wholesale burning, the British policy has, in
most instances, been very liberal indeed towards
the residents of the territory occupied; they have in
most cases paid high prices in cash for everything
that was needed for the use of the military, and
the people have not been annoyed any more than
was absolutely necessary for the good of the operations
of the army; but these two orders stagger
belief. They were not mere threats, but were
actually carried out to the letter, and are still in
operation. The one most damaging blow that a
force inferior in strength can strike is at the enemy’s
line of communication; therefore, so long as the fighting
goes on, the railway will be broken as often as
possible. More homes will be burned and more
men will be forced into the field; few farms will be
left undestroyed, and the country is likely to be
left desolate of inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Thus it is that the railroad plays such an important
part in the war of to-day. The railroad reconquered
the Soudan, and will eventually conquer the
entire continent of Africa. It is working down from
the north and up from the south, slowly but surely
throwing out its network of iron, from which nothing
can escape. It has reclaimed the great territory of
Siberia as it did our Western plains. It is the
mightiest engine of civilization in peace; it is the
very vitals of an army in war.</p>

<p class="p3 dc l2"><span class="smcap">When</span> rumors of war
crowd upon one another
until it seems
inevitable, the State
Departments of the
interested nations are
not more anxious
to anticipate coming
events than are the
corps of war correspondents
who wish
to follow the fate
and fortunes of the
armies. To be on the
spot when things happen
is the secret of their success; but during the past
few years, when wars have been so frequent, it has
been hard to decide where to go. It is not always
easy to get there after that decision is reached, for
in recent years war has been carried on in the most
remote and inaccessible places, and many weeks
were often lost in anxious travel before the scene
of action was reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
When I was leaving Havana, just after the American
occupation, a young officer there was ordered to
proceed at once to the Philippines. He packed all
his belongings, arranged his departure, and caught
a steamer for Tampa in two hours, bidding only
such friends good-by as he happened to be able to
hail from his cab on the way to the wharf. I met
him on the steamer, and all the way to Washington
he fretted and worried because steam could not
drive the passenger coaches fast enough. He feared
the war would be over before he could reach the
Philippines; he counted the days until he could get
there; he prayed that Aguinaldo might not surrender
until he arrived. I received a letter from him
a short time ago, and he is now praying that the
rebellious leader will surrender; and he added that
it was the one regret of his life that he did not miss
that steamer at San Francisco, as it would have
given him two weeks more at home.</p>

<p>In London, last year, a young Guardsman told me
almost tearfully that he was ordered out to South
Africa, but that he was sure Buller would finish up
the war before he could get there. More than six
months later I saw him in Pretoria, and he remarked
hopelessly that he had come to the conclusion
that he was now a permanent resident of the
Transvaal.</p>

<p>Having gone through similar anxieties myself
several times during the past few years, I had a
little faith that the Boers would be able to hold out
until I got there, but I naturally studied the quickest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
way to make the long journey. I was favored in
that the new army transport <i>Sumner</i> was ordered
from New York to Manila, and I secured a passage
direct to Suez. Not only was I helped along on
that journey, but I had an opportunity of studying
the new American transport service.</p>

<p>The mystery and awe which always attend a
great ship starting on a voyage across the trackless
ocean is intensified when the floating city is filled
with men of war, who are to face death in a far-off
land for their country’s honor; then the interest
becomes appealing and tender. Men who have left
home for the front or the post many times before
now leave under new and more unknown conditions.
Yet there seemed not to be an officer on the
<i>Sumner</i> who doubted his return to his native land
after winning honor on the field. Already, however,
several of those officers who were my companions
across the Atlantic and the Mediterranean,
and many of the men, have given up their lives
in the far East.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive and promising of the
officers on the <i>Sumner</i> was Captain McIniston of
the Fourth Infantry, over six feet of man, and of
powerful frame. He had won in Cuba several mentions
for conspicuous gallantry. But he had carried
from Santiago the seeds of tropic fever, which
were going with him now. He was appointed, upon
his arrival at the Philippines, to command a little
garrison, which the insurgents immediately besieged
in force. His fever developed rapidly under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
exposure and terrible strain of the siege, and at last,
when delirium had usurped his brain, he was shot
dead, in a panic, by his own soldiers—thus dying
the most pitiful death a soldier can know. The
comment of the bulletin, “temporary insanity,”
gave no hint of the bravery, dutifulness, and suffering
which had produced it, and which called for a
better fate.</p>

<p>The private soldier’s life while on a long ocean
voyage is made as easy and as pleasant as possible
by the officers in charge, and the entire trip is a rest
from arduous duty. It is recognized that no serious
work can be done at sea by any man not accustomed
to seafaring. A certain number are detailed
for assisting in the preparation and serving of the
meals, in keeping the quarters clean, and in a small
guard detail; but that is all. After the first few
days out the men are put through a regular amount
of health exercise, which consists chiefly of walking
and running around the decks. When time hangs
heavily, amusement is ready. The army department
of the Y. M. C. A. has been officially recognized by
the War Department, and men are detailed by the
Association to accompany the troops and furnish
entertainment which may occupy their minds. A
variety of games, from tiddledy-winks to chess, is
provided, and the man in charge of this valuable
work is active all the day and evening in keeping
the men amused. He arranges tournaments and
matches, and gives prizes for the winners. He suggests
different occupations for the idle men, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
this way does an immense amount of good. The
Association also provides reading matter sufficient
to occupy the minds of those who care to read.</p>

<p>An incident of peculiar interest was the visit we
paid to the Spanish garrison when the <i>Sumner</i>
stopped at Gibraltar. Crossing the neutral strip,
the American officers, in full uniform, drove into
the little Spanish military town. It was with a natural
doubt as to our reception that we made this
invasion. At once the strange uniforms engaged
attention, and then it was whispered and finally
shouted that <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">los Americanos soldados</i> were visiting
the place, and the crowds grew greater to gaze at
their former enemies. The salutations were of the
most friendly nature, and there seemed no trace of
Spanish animosity. A bunch of officers invited us
to remain for the morrow’s bull fight, and appeared
genuinely sorry that their invitation could not be
accepted. They discussed the Philippine situation
with friendly candor, sent messages to old acquaintances,
and rejoiced that they were not going themselves.</p>

<div id="i_199" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_199.jpg" width="348" height="545" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">British soldiers leaving the Sumner after having
exchanged uniforms with Americans.</div></div>

<p>At Malta the <i>Sumner</i> anchored only a couple
of lengths from shore, and her cable had hardly
been paid out before several boat-loads of British
Tommies were alongside. Then followed an extraordinary
exhibition of fraternization. The soldiers
of the two nations examined one another’s equipment
and uniforms and discussed their relative
usefulness. They finally began to exchange buttons
from their blouses and tunics, and before many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
minutes had passed the spirit of trade took their
fancy. A British soldier would admire the useful
campaign hat of an American, who in return would
declare what a good souvenir the “dinky lid” of
the Britisher would make for his family at home,
and the next moment they would swap. Then the
trading went into blouses, trousers, and shirts; at
least one entire boat-load of Tommies went back
in the full field uniform of the American army.
What afterwards happened to them when they encountered
the strict sergeant the Americans conjectured
with grins.</p>

<p>The American colonel, however, put his foot
down, and the amusing episode had to end, for the
regiment was going to land for parade the next day,
and there would not have been an entire uniform in
the lot had the men been allowed to keep on exchanging
clothes.</p>

<p>The parade on British soil, in the presence of a
British garrison, put the men on their mettle. As
the Philippine khaki had not then been issued, they
furbished up their worn blue suits until the uniforms
made an unusually good appearance.</p>

<p>Just before they landed, Captain McCoy stepped
out to give them a final word of advice. It was
short, and it expressed what every man was thinking
already.</p>

<p>“Remember one thing, men,” he said; “you are
going to be watched every minute you are on shore
by Britishers, so don’t forget that you are Americans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Although the men were nearly all recruits who
had never drilled together, even as companies, they
went ashore in a regimental formation which did
credit to our service. Every man marched and
drilled as though the eyes of all the British soldiers
about were directed upon him alone.</p>

<p>The British officers expressed much admiration
for the men, and gave our officers a good many
hearty compliments. They were a different type
of soldiers from any they had ever seen; they had
none of the fancy steps or hackney carriage of the
European soldier; they were, instead, plain, solid
men in uniform, nothing more; but they had the
swing and the soldierly alertness which stirs the blood
with its promise. British bands furnished the music
for the American troops, and the old ground of the
Knights of Malta heard such tunes as “Marching
Thro’ Georgia,” “Rally ’Round the Flag,” and
Sousa’s spirited marches, played for the friendly
tramp of the soldiers of the Republic in their first
parade on European soil.</p>

<p>The beautiful transport to which I bade good-by
at Port Saïd is as near perfection as a ship made on
this earth can aspire. This superlative has a right
to be used. The people of the United States have
been made familiar with the details of their perfected
warships; they have even more reason to be
proud of the superb completeness of their ships
which have been prepared for the comfort, health,
and good cheer of the American soldiers as they sail
around the world. From the dirty floating pens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
fever and misery which brought our men up from
Santiago to Montauk, to the cleanly, shining spaciousness
and undreamed-of conveniences of such
ships as the <i>Sumner</i>, is a far call; it seems as if
a century or two instead of a couple of years had
gone between.</p>

<p>The <i>Sumner</i> is a fair type of all the new army
transports now in use.</p>

<p>To begin with, she is well armed with four rapid-firing
guns, and belongs in reality to one of the class
of unprotected cruisers. She would make a formidable
foe in battle. Any distrust of the value of
such ships in time of war is dispelled when one
remembers the record of the American liners <i>St.
Paul</i> and <i>St. Louis</i> when they were converted into
cruisers; of the dashing <i>Gloucester</i>, which won immortality
on a Sunday morning at Santiago—only
a light-minded yacht a few days before; of the
stout <i>Hudson</i>, a conscript tug-boat, which, under
the command of Lieutenant Scott, participated in
the engagement of Cardenas Harbor, and finally
rescued the torpedo-boat <i>Winslow</i> after it was disabled
and helpless under the enemy’s guns.</p>

<p>The transports are, in appearance, regular merchant-built
ships; they are not only armed, but
they are fitted with every known appointment for
the comfort, health, and general welfare of the
troops. Each man sleeps in a comfortable bunk
built on iron standards, to which are fastened the
springs on which rests a mattress. The seating
capacity of the tables equals the conveying capacity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of the ship; yet, as soon as the meals are finished,
the tables may be folded away, leaving a large deck
room for the enjoyment of the men. Bath appliances
of the latest pattern furnish opportunities for
cleanliness and comfort not excelled in garrison. A
store gives the men an opportunity to buy almost
any article necessary to their comfort or pleasure.
All sorts of food supplies, of a better grade than
are usually furnished, articles of clothing, games,
candy, fruit, and all the ordinary articles in demand,
are to be found in the ship’s store. The prices
charged for these articles are only their cost to
the government; and, as the government buys in
large quantities, the shop makes a very economical
place for the men to trade.</p>

<p>The hospital and drug store hold all that is wanted
by modern medical science. There is an operating-room
containing every known appliance useful in
surgery; the whole room is finished in marble tiling,
while all the metal work is shining nickel. Here is
the electric apparatus necessary to operations, a
Roentgen ray apparatus, batteries for treatment of
certain diseases, and, in fact, all the devices and
mechanisms used in a city hospital. The hospital
beds are as comfortable as could be made on ship-board,
all being supplied with necessary supports,
bridges for removing the weight of the bed-clothes,
and tables for the use of the reclining patient.</p>

<p>There is a system of cold storage and ice manufacture
which makes it possible to carry a five
months’ supply of fresh food stuffs for a full complement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of troops, so that the transport can take
on a supply of rations at a home port and not be
compelled to replenish until it returns again to
America. The kitchens, bakeries, and laundries
might belong to a Fifth Avenue hotel, so perfect
are they in every detail.</p>

<p>One of the most important and useful features of
this magnificent ship is the arrangement for supplying
a cold-air draft during hot weather. The fresh-air
supply is so forced over ammonia pipes that it is
cooled and then discharged throughout the entire
ship. Each cabin, each deck, and every part of the
great vessel receives its supply of fresh air in this
manner, so that even in tropical weather the interior
of the transport is very comfortable. During winter
weather the air supply may be heated to a sufficient
degree to create warmth throughout the vessel.</p>

<p>The officers’ quarters are the final model of comfort.
On the <i>Sumner</i> there are accommodations
for more than sixty officers. Thirteen bath-rooms
belong to them. These baths are the most perfect
made by scientific plumbing; each has a great porcelain
tub, with its spray and shower; each room is
done in white marble tiles, with nickel fittings
throughout. There is a large dining-saloon and
also a comfortable smoking-room. In short, every
comfort that is known, afloat or ashore, for both
officers and men, is included in these new transports,
which are in all respects a distinguished honor to
our government.</p>

<p>In her fleet of splendid transports, of which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
<i>Sumner</i> is a fair example, the United States now
leads the world. Indeed, ours is the only government
that has a complete transport service of its
own regularly equipped. The others have a continuous
use of hired transports. The British abandoned
their governmental transport service a few years ago
as a failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
The American fleet of transports has been built
up entirely since the war with Spain by the purchase
and reconstruction of a number of vessels from
the merchant marine. It grew out of sheer and
alarming necessity.</p>

<p>When the war with Spain broke out, and it became
necessary to transport General Shafter’s army
to Cuba, the government was compelled to use every
sort of vessel which the entire Atlantic seaboard
could produce to get a sufficient number flying the
American flag to carry a little army of 15,000 men a
few hundred miles. So serious was the problem
that old side-wheelers were used, as well as a great
number of ancient craft that were barely seaworthy.
This humiliating condition stands in contrast with
England’s readiness when the South African War
called for transports. She sent over 220,000 men
several thousand miles by sea, on British bottoms,
without making so much as a ripple on the surface
of maritime commerce and traffic. The experience
of Japan in her war against China in 1895 might
have taught us a lesson. After her first army had
sailed and landed and fought, operations were practically
suspended for months, as there were not
enough ships available to carry over the second
army. But we do not learn our lessons that way,
and we required our own melancholy experience,
both in the confusion of the hired ships off Daiquiri
and in their cruel inadequacy for the broken-down
soldiers on the return voyage, to teach us the need
of regular and model transports for our armies across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the sea. In view of this costly experience it seems
like an unpatriotic thing for the private lines now
running to Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines to
be engineering a movement to have our proud little
national fleet of transports abolished.</p>

<p>Our transport service is adequate for our present
needs, but in the event of a new war, which might
require us to send an enlarged army over seas, we
are practically no better prepared than in 1898; for
there are no more ships in the merchant marine carrying
the United States flag which could be drafted
into service than were in commission then. There
are practically no American ships in trans-oceanic
service outside those of the government. During
the past year I sailed entirely around the continent
of Africa, through the Mediterranean, touching at
many of the important ports on the route. In all
that time I saw but two vessels flying the American
flag. One was a little lumber schooner from Maine,
lying in the harbor of Madeira; the other was a bark,
at Cape Town, over which there was an immense
amount of trouble raised because the crew refused
to take her out to sea on account of her unseaworthy
condition. Consul-General Stow was making an investigation
to estimate whether the hulk would float
long enough to get back to an American port, not to
be condemned, but to be painted over and sent out
again, a disgrace to the nation. American vessels
do not carry five per cent. of our exports abroad, for
what American tonnage we have is suitable chiefly
for coastwise and lake navigation. While England’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
red ensign of the merchant marine is seen over the
stern in every port of the navigable world, to our
shame, a ship flying the stars and stripes is a stranger
on the seas.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we pay out $165,000,000 each
year to foreign ships simply to carry our products
abroad. We need our own ships for our own traffic.
We may suddenly need them some day for availability
in war.</p>

<p>There seems to be but one way in which to build
up an American merchant marine without waiting
for another generation. That is to permit ships to
become naturalized. There are to-day hundreds of
foreign-built ships plying to our ports, knocking at
the door of the United States to be admitted under
American registry, so that they may fly the American
flag, but because they are foreign-built they are
debarred. Men, women, and children are allowed to
become citizens of our country and to enjoy our
privileges; why, then, should we not allow ships to
do likewise? Protection to the home trade of ship-building
is the reason for debarring those who want
American registry. We need make no quarrel with
the good principle of protection when we remind
ourselves that our ship-building does not need such
drastic measures as that; we build good ships, and foreign
powers are ordering even their ships of war from
our yards. It will be a greater benefit to all our shipping
to allow the flag to be raised over as many vessels
as will accept its protection, and in building up
our shipping our ship-building industry will increase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
It is simply not possible for the United States to
acquire, within a reasonably short space of time, a
sufficient shipping to occupy any important position
in the control of the merchant marine of the world
without admitting foreign-built ships. A large
amount of American capital has been invested for
some time in foreign-built ships, the desire of the
owners of these vessels being to place them under
the American flag; but they have been prevented
from doing so by our government. It seems only
fair that our citizens who have invested their capital
in this way should be in a position to realize the
benefits that would accrue by having them under
the American flag, provided they would agree within
a reasonably short time to add to the tonnage so
admitted an equal amount of American-built tonnage,
thus building up a large American marine, and
at the same time securing a large amount of work to
the American ship-building interests.</p>

<p>A Shipping Subsidy Bill, not unlike the one so
long before Congress would, if passed, materially
help the merchant marine of this country. It would
make it possible for the United States to occupy
a leading position among the shipping interests of
the world, instead of its present insignificant place.
To-day it is impossible for the United States, with
its scale of wages and larger amount of compensation
to seamen and officers, to compete with countries
where there is absolute freedom in the employment
of help and in the scale of wages, without
some such assistance. In addition to this, the cost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
of ship-building in the United States is so much
greater than that of foreign countries that the questions
of interest, depreciation, and additional insurance
would make it impossible for the owner of
American ships to compete with foreign-built ships
without assistance; and those countries which have
recently built up their merchant marine—notably
Japan—have done so by such help.</p>

<p>The matter of raising the American flag over
every good ship that is willing to fly it most immediately
concerns the commercial world; but there is
another side of the question to be considered. So
long as we are friendly with Great Britain we shall
undoubtedly be able to borrow her ships with which
to transport our troops or to use as hospital ships;
but if we should ever have any serious difficulty
with that country it would be very difficult for us
to obtain a sufficient number of ships to transport
our troops without stopping all trade. We must
remember that most of the vessels of our new transport
service formerly flew the Union Jack of Great
Britain. If it is thus necessary for the United
States to buy its ships of a foreign power for this
service, our lack of such material is conspicuous.</p>

<p class="clear">An excellent example of the advantage to our
interests in offering our flag to ships that desire it is
afforded by the attitude of the Atlantic Transport
Line. That large fleet of steamships is owned and
governed by Americans. Ninety per cent. of the
stock is held in this country; more than half of the
officers of the company are Americans. The owners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
want the American flag to replace that of England,
but they are unable to accomplish their desire owing
to the present laws. This fleet would be a magnificent
addition to the little shipping our country has
at present; not only would it be a valuable addition
to commerce, but it would be of inestimable value
in time of war. In fact, it would be almost like
building fifteen or twenty extra transports, for the
line has proved its willingness to turn over its ships
to the government when necessary. The transports
<i>Thomas</i>, <i>Sherman</i>, <i>Logan</i>, <i>Sheridan</i>, <i>Grant</i>, <i>Buford</i>,
<i>Kilpatrick</i> were all formerly ships of the Atlantic
Transport Line, as were also the hospital ships,
the <i>Missouri</i> and the <i>Maine</i>.</p>

<p>The two new ships built by this line, the <i>Minnehaha</i>
and the <i>Minneapolis</i>, are undoubtedly better
adapted for use as transports than any other
private ships afloat to-day. They are especially
adapted for the transportation of mounted troops,
the most difficult problem of ocean carriage. These
two sister ships are among the largest afloat, and
have permanent accommodations for one thousand
animals, so arranged that a long voyage could be
made without any serious loss of stock. Their freeboard
is exceptionally high, and their immense deck
room would allow transportation of many guns and
troops. The cabin accommodations are ample; in
fact, if these ships had been especially built for use
as transports they could scarcely be constructed
in a more available manner. They are not as fast as
some of the mail steamers, but they are fast enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to keep up to any convoy, and what they lack in
speed they make up in steadiness. I crossed in
the <i>Minnehaha</i> during the most violent part of
the great storm that swept across Galveston, and
although the seas ran mountains high it was not
found necessary to put the racks on the tables save
one day, and even then they were not really needed.
The steady running is due to the broad bottom and
the extra wide bilge-keels. If some heavy rapid-fire
guns were mounted on these ships, as they were
put on the American liners, the <i>St. Paul</i> and the
<i>St. Louis</i>, they would make the best transports ever
seen; they could go almost anywhere without convoy
of warships, and still take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Were it permitted by the laws of this country
these ships, as well as every other of the Atlantic
Transport Line, would fly the American flag immediately.</p>

<p>Hospital ships have played an important part in
the wars of the past three years, and they have
become a necessary adjunct to the transportation
department of the army. All of our new transports
are fitted out with hospital appliances; but separate
vessels for nothing but hospital work have been
equipped, and have done excellent work in both the
Spanish-American and the South African wars.</p>

<p>When the negotiations were opened by the United
States Government for the purchase of ships to be
used as transports, it was also determined to fit out
one as a hospital ship, to be used with the fleet or to
be stationed at any port which the operations might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
include. Mr. B. N. Baker, president of the Atlantic
Transport Line, tendered to the government the
choice of his ships for hospital service, fully manned
and free of expense to the government, and furthermore
made his offer to cover the indefinite period of
“the continuance of the war.” The <i>Missouri</i> was
chosen as the ship best suited to the work, and she
was found so valuable for this purpose that, after
the war, the government purchased her at an exceedingly
low figure.</p>

<p>The <i>Missouri</i> has had a romantic life ever
since she has been afloat, and has seemed destined
to be a life saver and general benefactor to mankind
in distress. On April 5, 1889, the <i>Missouri</i>
overhauled the <i>Denmark</i>, of Copenhagen, which
was in a sinking condition, having on board over
seven hundred souls. The <i>Missouri</i> stood by and
threw her entire cargo into the sea in order to
take on this load of human freight. Not a soul
was lost, and the heroism of that day’s work was
rewarded by decorations and medals from nearly
every kingdom of Europe. The insurance companies
offered to pay the loss of the cargo, as though
it had been lost by wreck; but the owners would
not accept this, taking the entire loss themselves.
In 1892 the <i>Missouri</i> carried the gift of a load of
flour to the famine-stricken people of Russia, the
company furnishing the crew, fuel, and cost of transportation.
During this year she picked up two
more ships at sea—the <i>Delaware</i> and the <i>Bertha</i>—and
towed them safely into port. There is thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
a poetic fitness that this ordinary freighter, which
has been the cause of saving thousands of lives,
should have become a regular hospital ship in the
government service.</p>

<p>In recognition of this magnificent gift, prompted
by true patriotism, Congress passed the following
resolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, by the Senate and the House of Representatives,
That in recognition of the patriotism
and generosity of Bernard N. Baker in donating
the use of the steamship <i>Missouri</i> to the United
States, with the services of her captain and crew,
during the war with Spain, the cordial thanks of
Congress are hereby tendered to him, and Congress
hereby authorizes and directs that a gold medal with
appropriate design be prepared by the Director of
the Mint, and that said medal be presented to him
by the President of the United States at such time
as he may determine.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Baker repeated his generous offer when he
gave the <i>Maine</i> to the American ladies in London
to be fitted out as a hospital ship similar to the
<i>Missouri</i>. Lady Randolph Churchill (now Mrs.
Cornwallis West, Jr.) took the matter in charge and
worked unremittingly until the ship was sent to
South Africa fully equipped. From October, 1899,
to July, 1900, the <i>Maine</i> ministered to the needs
of the sick and wounded from South Africa.
Then she sailed for Chinese waters, there to undertake
the nursing of the British and American
soldiers alike. All this time she has been manned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
coaled, and run by Mr. Baker entirely at his own
expense.</p>

<p>The transportation of troops at sea is a problem
of the first importance in war. The government of
the United States has solved it for the present by
purchasing and equipping a fleet of model transports.
Great Britain has solved it by abandoning
her former fleet of government ships and using her
immense merchant marine. Her conspicuous success
in carrying promptly and comfortably over
200,000 soldiers to South Africa shows that the resource
was ample and that she fully understands the
work. The men in khaki fared well on their long
journey to the south, and the absence of any complaints
speaks well for the staff of the British army
which had the task in hand. But the chief secret of
the success was in the fact that there were ships
without limit for selection, and only the best and
largest and swiftest were chosen. At the same time
they did not find it necessary to disturb the transatlantic
commerce by drawing off the great liners.</p>

<p>It is not a pleasant comparison when one thinks
that Great Britain sent the greatest army she ever
brought together to almost the remotest quarter of
the globe without any apparent effect on sea-going
traffic, while the United States in 1898 had to
scrape together every hulk that would float in order
to transport a single army corps a few hundred
miles.</p>

</div>

<p class="dc"><span class="smcap">Before</span> the British advance
reached Johannesburg one
would never have known, by
merely taking note of the life in
Pretoria, that a fierce war was
being waged in the country. The
ladies went on with their calling
and shopping, business houses carried
on their work as usual, and the
hotels were crowded with a throng
of men who looked more like speculators
in a new country than men
fighting for their homes and liberty.</p>

<p>The night I arrived in Pretoria
the train pulled into the station
just after dark, and the street lights gave the
place an air of mystery. The blackness of the
night heightened one’s imagination of possible
plots and attempted escapes, of spies and sudden
attacks. A big Scotchman, who told me his name
was “Jack,” shared the compartment with me; he
was returning from the front, where he had been
fighting for his adopted country. He carried a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Mauser, and over his shoulder was slung a bandolier
of cartridges; these, with his belt and canteen,
made up his entire equipment. His pockets were
his haversack, his big tweed coat was his blanket.
He gave me the first idea of the real bitterness of the
struggle, for he said he would rather die many times
over than give up to the British. He was fighting
against men of his own blood, perhaps his very relatives;
but the spirit of liberty was in him, and he
was defending the home he had built in this faraway
land.</p>

<p>As the train rolled around the curve into Pretoria,
the Scotch burgher pointed out a brilliant circle of
lights on a far side of the great group of flickering
yellow lamps which showed the position of the
town. The effect of mystery deepened as I peered
out at the station platform and saw little groups of
men huddled together in the radius of the dazzling
electric arcs. Here and there a solitary figure with
a rifle walked slowly about. The doors had been
locked before we entered the town, and no one was
allowed to leave the train until an official with a
decidedly English air had examined all the passports.
I wondered whether I should be able to
make myself understood, and whether, in case I
were mistaken for a British spy, I should be followed
by some secret agent of the Republic. Suddenly
a sharp cry at my door broke in upon my
fanciful surmises.</p>

<p>“Free ’bus to the Transvaal Hotel,” shouted a
voice from the figure outlined against the bright light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
“Grand Hotel! The Grand! Grand Hotel!”
and in another instant I was wrestling against an unseen
hand for the possession of my luggage.</p>

<p>“Cab, sir? Cab up-town, sir?”</p>

<p>My dream of war’s mysteries was shattered in an
instant, and I found myself on earth again, with the
feeling that I was just arriving at the San Francisco
ferry from an overland train. In another moment I
was in a hotel omnibus illuminated with a dingy,
smoking oil lamp at the front end. Under the lamp
there was a little sign imparting the information
that the vehicle had been built in Philadelphia. We
rumbled along over the rough streets, and the windows
rattled in true hotel ’bus fashion. We pulled
up at a hotel, and a porter greeted us with a sixpence’s
worth of politeness and assistance. “Good
evening, sir,” he remarked, with a “Dooley” accent
which was pleasantly reassuring.</p>

<p>The clerk at the desk cordially called me by name—after
I had registered—and informed me that he
could give me a room at the top of the house for five
dollars a day. After depositing my belongings I took
a look at the crowd of men in the hotel office. I was
reminded of the gatherings in a California “boom
town” hotel, or of a Colorado mining camp. There
were men of all nations and in all sorts of dress; but
the prevalence of top boots and leggins gave to the
crowd a peculiarly Western look. Rifles stood in
the corners of the room, but except for this item
there was nothing about the men to denote their
connection with the war. They were nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
speaking English. By that time I began to feel
that I had been cheated, for I wanted to hear some
Dutch. It is a fact, however, that in all my stay in
the Transvaal I found absolutely no use for any but
my own tongue.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Leggett, the California mining engineer
who, after twelve years’ residence in South
Africa, rose to be the leading engineer in that country,
told me that he did not know five words of
Dutch even after his long stay among the Boers,
and, moreover, that he had had no occasion whatever
to use that language.</p>

<p>When I first met the family of Secretary Reitz, I
asked a little boy of about ten if he spoke English.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he exclaimed with emphasis; “we
don’t speak English down here—we speak American.”</p>

<p>There was formerly a complaint that the English
language was not taught in the schools, but the
assertion proved erroneous, and to-day it is the
common tongue of the towns and cities of South
Africa.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the war but few Americans had
lived in Pretoria, consequently the official duties of
our consul to that place had not been onerous.
When the war broke out, Mr. Macrum was the representative
of our government; but, owing to what
appeared to be an excess of desire to aid the burghers’
cause, he overstepped the diplomatic reserve
and was recalled. Several South African officials
told me that he had acted unwisely in endeavoring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
to do too much, and that had he been more discreet
he might have been of material assistance to them.
When Mr. Macrum was recalled, the Hon. Adelbert
S. Hay, son of Secretary of State Hay, was appointed
to fill the position that had now become a
post of great importance. There was much speculation
as to the new American consul’s ability to fill
the place, and he was received with some misgivings
by the statesmen of the Transvaal, for fear his sentiments
were in favor of their enemy. But his years
of training in affairs of state under his father, both
at home and at the embassy in London, had made
him equal to the task. In a very few days he
proved himself to be a thorough diplomatist, and he
came to be heartily liked by all the burghers who
were brought in contact with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Hay had the sole charge of all British interests,
as well as the care of the thousands of English
prisoners who were in Pretoria, and of the transmission
of all letters and moneys. All these duties he
performed without arousing the slightest animosity
on the part of the Boers. No American of any
class ever went to the consulate on business, for a
social call, or from idle curiosity, without receiving
a hearty welcome from the consul. And to please
unanimously the crowd of resident Americans, soldiers
of fortune, correspondents, doctors, and ne’er-do-wells,
was in itself enough to show his worth
as a diplomatist. Mr. Gardner F. Coolidge, of
Boston, was the vice-consul, and in cordial service
and discreetness he proved to be made of the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
stuff as his chief. They
attended not only to
their own official affairs,
as well as the British
interests, but they were
often called upon to
assist men of other nationalities,
which they
did as willingly as
though they had nothing
else to do.</p>

<div id="i_222" class="figleft" style="max-width: 17em;">

  <div class="caption">Consul Hay and Vice-Consul

<p>During the few weeks
before the British occupation
there was
hardly a ripple of excitement
among the
people of Pretoria; in fact, there was more South
African war talk in Washington and New York
when I left the United States than I heard in the
capital of the Republic most interested.</p>

<p>President Krüger was the center of all interest,
although when any of the hundreds of foreigners
that swarmed the place wanted anything, they went
to Secretary Reitz, who seemed to have more power
than even the President himself.</p>

<p>My last meeting with President Krüger was on
the occasion of the presentation of the celebrated
message of sympathy from 30,000 Philadelphia
schoolboys. The voluminous document was delivered
by James Smith, a New York American District
Messenger boy, who was accompanied by one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
of the editors of a Philadelphia newspaper, Mr.
Hugh Sutherland. This opportunity afforded an
excellent chance to study the wonderful old man
who has piloted the Cape Dutch through so many
national storms.</p>

<p>If President Krüger had been a handsome, polished,
and dignified man the world’s opinion of the
Transvaal burgher would have been entirely different,
for the descriptions of the typical Boer have had
their origin in his personality. He is far from prepossessing;
he is entirely lacking in polish or distinction
of appearance. He wears a shabby frock
coat that looks as though it had never been brushed
or cleaned since the day it left a ready-made stock.
His clothes, however, are not the most notable nor
the most repellent characteristic of the head of the
Transvaal government. Mr. Krüger smokes a pipe
incessantly, and has an unpleasant habit of expectorating
in any place that pleases his momentary
fancy, and with very little accuracy of aim; even
the front of his clothes shows signs of this habit. His
eyes are inflamed, and are seemingly afflicted with
some ophthalmic disease which causes the lids to
show lines of red under the eyeball. His hair and
beard are unkempt, except on state occasions and
Sundays, when they are brushed to an oiled nicety.
His hands are heavy, as though from great toil; but
when he shook hands, he did so in the cordial manner
of one who wished to show a heartfelt welcome to
his guest.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Reitz arranged this meeting at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
which Jimmie Smith should present the message he
had carried so far, and when the little party arrived
at the President’s house, he was waiting to receive
them in his library.</p>

<p>The house in which President Krüger lives is a
little, low, unpretentious cottage, such as might be
owned by an ordinarily prosperous mechanic or
tradesman in a country village. It is a one-story
building, with a wide veranda along the front. On
either side of the entrance is a marble figure of a
reclining lion, the gift of Barney Barnato a few years
ago, when he wished to gain favor in order to further
some of the great schemes which eventually
were the direct cause of the downfall of the two
South African republics.</p>

<p>The library where the President met the party
was a dark room with a low ceiling. At the farther
end of the apartment was a desk table, at which the
Chief Executive sat. The ornaments about the room
were tawdry and cheap, showing how little attention
was paid to appearance; nevertheless, everything
was scrupulously clean. Books and papers were
scattered about in confusion; but, as we afterwards
learned, this grand disorder was due to the fact
that the President was preparing for his departure
from the capital, a fugitive from the conquerors who
were even then just outside the city.</p>

<p>All thought of the peculiar personal appearance
of President Krüger was dispelled when he spoke,
or even when he was listening to anything of importance;
for he conveyed the impression of being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
possessor of a great reserve force, and of a wonderful
mental power which grasped a subject instantly
and with precision. Once in touch with the workings
of his great brain, his untidy appearance was
forgotten, and you thought of him as a magnificent
relic of the noble Dutch blood, one who had
reclaimed a new continent from wild beasts and
wilder savages; a man who had fought his way, foot
by foot, into the great veldt and into the mountains,
and had built a home for thousands of contented
followers, only to be driven out by a more powerful
nation.</p>

<p>At the time when the messenger boy presented
the greetings from the young Americans, the President
was visibly worried and his mind was evidently
occupied by other matters. Within a few hours he
expected to move once more from the place where
he had settled, as he had done when he was a young
man. But this time he was to go he knew not
where, a fugitive from an overwhelming foe.</p>

<p>As Mr. Reitz translated the speech which little
Jimmie Smith cleverly delivered when he presented
the documents he carried, the President listened graciously
and thanked the boy heartily for the expressions
of sympathy conveyed in the message. Coming
at that time, it must have given him some little hope
that the first republic of the world would do something
towards saving to the list of nations these two
republics of South Africa.</p>

<p>A granddaughter of President Krüger told me
that, after he left, Mrs. Krüger, who stayed in Pretoria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
spent much time
reading the book of
American newspaper
and magazine clippings
regarding the Boer war
which accompanied the
message from Philadelphia.
She was deeply
gratified to note the
sympathetic sentiments
so strongly stated in
the American press.</p>

<div id="i_226" class="figleft" style="max-width: 16.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="265" height="326" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A. D. T. Messenger James
Smith, in front of President
Krüger’s house, immediately
after presenting
the message from the American
children.</div></div>

<p>As soon as the presentation
took place the
President shook hands
with every one present,
and then dismissed
them politely, saying,
“You must excuse me now, as matters of great
importance concerning the state occupy my mind.”
That night, just before midnight, the President and
Secretary Reitz left Pretoria.</p>

<p>James Smith, A. D. T. Messenger, No. 1534, was
well chosen for his mission, and he proved himself
to be worthy of the task. After the message
was delivered he stayed in Pretoria for several weeks
during the British occupation. During the battle of
Pretoria he amused himself by running about in the
district near the American consulate, where the
shells were falling thickest, picking up chunks of the
deadly missiles, unmindful of the great danger he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
was incurring. Very few men have been under a
heavier fire than was this American messenger boy
on the day of the taking of Pretoria. That night he
told of how he waited for the shells to explode, and
then ran and picked up the pieces wherever he saw
them kick up the dust.</p>

<p>“It was just like the Fourth,” was his comment
on an all day’s battle which did as much to reëstablish
England’s prestige as any that has been fought
in many years. The fight itself lasted but one day,
but the effect of the occupation of the capital of the
South African Republic by the British army worked
wonders in the opinion of the world as to the progress
of the war.</p>

<p>As Lord Roberts’s army came nearer and nearer
to the doomed capital, the excitement grew more
intense and the air was filled with alarming rumors.
General Botha came back to Pretoria and established
his headquarters there in order to reconstruct his
forces, which were badly scattered, and to provision
them from the government stores. Extra calls for
burghers to rally to the cause were issued every day
and were responded to by hundreds. Pretoria was
the turning point of the war, at which men were
called on to decide for themselves whether they
would continue the struggle to the bitter end, or
leave on the last trains for Delagoa Bay and sail for
Europe, or remain in the city and quietly allow the
British to overtake them, thus being possibly overlooked
among the hundreds of peaceable citizens.</p>

<p>Arms were issued from the arsenal to all those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
who wished to continue the fight or who wished to
cast their lot for the first time with the army of the
two states. There were arms and ammunition in
abundance for hundreds more men than came to
take them, for the supply had been laid in with the
idea of eventually arming every man and boy in the
Transvaal. Many of the burghers exchanged their
well-battered rifles for new ones; all filled their ammunition
belts, and took in other ways all they could
besides.</p>

<p>Hundreds responded to the final call to arms.
Many burghers collected their entire families and
secured arms for them to assist in the struggle. It
is not possible for any one who has not seen that
army fighting in South Africa to realize how deadly
is their earnestness. Some of the men are so old as
to appear incapable of sitting in a saddle for a march
of even a few miles, to say nothing of the marches
they often make, covering several days. There are
young men in the prime of life, strong and sturdy;
there are boys in knee trousers, who do not look old
enough to have sufficient strength to endure the
hardships of war or to know how to do any real
fighting. There are even women who have followed
their husbands or brothers through it all, attending
the wounded, and cooking when necessary, but often
going into the fighting line and matching the men
with a rifle.</p>

  <div class="caption">The battle of Pretoria: British naval

<p>The Boer army entered the second year of the
war a far more formidable force than the one that
fought through the first year, and especially during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
the first months of the war. At that time the army
was filled with men who had been commandeered
and who were compelled to go into the field, but
who were not obliged to fight, and often did not
fight. There were also many adventurers from
other nations, seeking a little fame, and perhaps
fortune. But now there is not a man in the field
who is not there to fight, and when they went out
of Pretoria they knew they were burning their
bridges behind them. It was for this reason that
fathers took their young sons with them, and it was
for the same reason that the women followed the men.</p>

<p>One day I was in General Botha’s headquarters,
just before he was leaving Pretoria for good, when
an old gray-haired burgher came in to see him. He
waited some minutes, as the general was busy, but
finally stepped up to his desk. He did not give the
regulation military salute, but merely shook hands
with General Botha and wished him health in the
Dutch fashion.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” asked the Boer leader,
still looking over some papers before him.</p>

<p>“I would like to get an order for a carbine from
you,” answered the burgher.</p>

<p>“You cannot get a carbine, for they are very
scarce just now, and every one seems to want them;
but I will give you an order on the commandant at
the arsenal for a rifle,” said the general, and he
began to write the order at once.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry; but a rifle won’t do,” hesitated
the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
General Botha looked up quickly, and said with
some sharpness:</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why a rifle won’t do; you will
use a rifle or nothing.”</p>

<p>The old burgher still hesitated; then finally said,
“I’d just as soon have a rifle, but I’m afraid my
boy isn’t big enough to carry one.” He turned and
motioned to a little smooth-faced lad to come forward.</p>

<p>He was not yet ten years old—a bashful yet
manly little fellow, ready to follow his grandfather
and to fight for the cause for which his father had
died. Not big enough to carry a rifle, he must
needs fight with a carbine. He got his carbine.</p>

<p>This incident is typical of the spirit that prevails
among the Boers who are now in the field, and it is
that unconquerable spirit that will fight on as long
as there is a man still free on the wide veldt or in
the mountains.</p>

<p>It was thought at first that the capital would be
defended to the last, according to the intention
when the forts were first built. But after long
debate it was decided that Pretoria should not be
defended, and two very excellent reasons were given
for abandoning the capital to the British without
resistance. One was that the officials did not wish
to subject their families and the families of their men
to the suffering of a siege, or their buildings to the
mercy of the British guns. The principal reason,
however, was that if they should defend the capital
it would be necessary to use all the troops of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Transvaal army and would allow the English troops
to surround them, cutting off all possibility of escape
or retreat. Thus their cause would be lost. But
with the removal of their forces to the high veldt or
to the mountains they could continue the struggle
many months.</p>

  <div class="caption">General De la Rey and staff at Pretoria;

<p>An air of suppressed excitement pervaded all
Pretoria when the people knew that the Volksraad
was in session to decide the fate of the city. It
meant either a long period of suffering or British
occupation within a very few days. Little knots of
men gathered here and there to discuss the situation
and to speculate on the result of the deliberations
of the few men who held the fate of all in their
hands.</p>

<div id="i_233" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.875em;">

  <div class="caption">Field cornets in Pretoria receiving orders from a general.</div></div>

<p>Finally the word came—it was “Retreat.” Once
more they were to retire before the hordes of khaki
that were steadily pouring in from all directions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
There were no noisy newsboys shouting “Extra!”
There were no bulletins placarded in public places.
But the news seemed to proclaim itself in the very
air. From mouth to mouth it flew, carrying with it
feelings of terror, defiance, and sadness. The moment
which had been half expected and dreaded for
years had come at last. Their enemy was upon
them in irresistible force, and they were to abandon
their homes and their chief city to the foe. The
little groups of men melted away as if by magic,
and the streets were suddenly alive with a hurrying
mass of people, each person with but one thought—to
escape before the British arrived. The town
was filled with rumors of the movements of the
enemy, and runners said that they would be upon
us within a few hours; that the advance was already
on the outskirts of the town; that Botha had been
defeated; that Pretoria was completely surrounded—every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
runner had some kind of unpleasant news to tell.</p>

<p>During the next hour or so men were obliged to
decide quickly what was to be done with their families
and personal effects. It was the crucial moment
of the war, as it was then thought that it was but a
matter of minutes before the British would arrive.</p>

<p>I happened to be at the railway station on the
night the President and Secretary Reitz left with the
State documents and moneys, removing the capital
and head of the government from Pretoria. About
half-past eleven a special train, consisting of three
or four luggage vans, a few passenger carriages, a
few goods carriages, and, at the end, the President’s
private coach. Nothing had been said about the
removal, but from some remark coming from Mr.
Reitz I imagined that something unusual was about
to happen, and therefore awaited developments.
There was no unwonted excitement about the station,
and, with the exception of a few burghers who
were awaiting the departure of the train, there was
no one about except Mr. Sutherland and myself.
In a few moments a small wagon drove hurriedly up
to the station, a couple of men jumped out and
gave orders to the driver to drive out on the platform
near the train; this being done, they began to
transfer a load of books and papers into the luggage
van. Another cart arrived before the first one was
emptied, also containing huge bundles of papers and
documents. During the next half hour there came
a stream of vehicles of every description, loaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
with bags of gold and silver. Even cabs had been
pressed into the service of transferring the treasure
of the state from the mint to the train. Bars of the
precious metal were thrown out of the cabs or
wagons like so much rubbish.</p>

  <div class="caption">Russian hospital corps with the Boers: the

<p>There was bustle and activity, but no noise and
no excitement. A few burghers on the platform
crowded about in the glare of the electric light,
to watch the work; but there was hardly a word
spoken, except an occasional command from one of
the clerks attending to the removal. Cab after cab
drove up to the station without any guard whatever;
some of them, containing as much as £20,000
in sovereigns, had been driven by boys through the
dark streets from the treasury to the station. The
cabs were hurriedly unloaded and sent back for another
load, while the men on the platform were
busily throwing the bags and bars into the car.</p>

<p>One boy had driven away a hundred yards into
the darkness when he called out that there was a
sack in his cab that had been overlooked. An attendant
went after it and brought it back—a sack
containing several thousand dollars’ worth of gold
coin.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary sight, under the glare of
the electric lights, to see this train being loaded
with all that was left of the capital of the Republic.
It was done decently and rapidly. As soon as the
last sack of gold was transferred to the train the
doors were closed. Secretary Reitz alighted from a
cab and walked towards the train. As he passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
under the light I saw an expression of sadness and
anxiety on his face that forbade my speaking, although
I knew him well and realized that I might
not see him again. He entered the private car,
and in a few moments the train departed, President
Krüger boarding it a few blocks from the station,
and for a few weeks the capital of the South African
Republic was on wheels.</p>

<p>Many have blamed President Krüger for running
away, as they call it, and for leaving the country
and going to Europe. But there is no doubt that
he was pursuing the proper course. He was an old
man, much too feeble to follow the commands in
their marches through the mountains. Had he
attempted to do this he would have been merely a
hindrance to the rapid movements of the army.
He is charged with taking away gold for his personal
use; but if he took any of the state funds with
him I do not think they were for his own use. He
is a very wealthy man. Money was of no value to
the burghers in the field, but it could be used in
Europe to their advantage. It would have availed
nothing for Mr. Krüger to remain in the Transvaal
only to be captured and sent to St. Helena. Such
an event would have helped the British immensely,
and would have given a certain plausibility to the
assertion that the war was over. The criticism
against the President because he left the country
was confined entirely to those who ran away themselves,
for among the loyalists in Pretoria there was
not a word of complaint against his course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
One commandant reminded me that the capital
of the United States of America was for months
wherever General Washington’s headquarters were,
and that even in the war of 1812 the capital was
removed before the advance of the British on the
city of Washington. He asked if any one had ever
criticised the American President for not remaining
to be taken prisoner, or for not leaving the gold in
the treasury to fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Following the departure of the President and
other officials, on the last of May, came a couple of
days of panic, during which all sorts of rumors flew
about, while the lawless element of the town played
havoc. As soon as it was decided to abandon the
capital, all the government stores which had been
gathered for the use of the army in the event of a
siege were turned over to the people for their own
use. The stores, which were in large warehouses,
were broken open and rifled by a wild, excited
crowd from every station of society. Well-dressed
men and women jostled with half-naked Kaffirs in
their efforts to secure a goodly share of the stores.
Every sort of vehicle was brought to carry away
their plunder. Not one in a hundred had any idea
that the stores had been turned over to the public
by the officials in charge; they thought they were
looting without permission, and were correspondingly
mad with excitement.</p>

<p>The doors of the warehouses proved too small to
admit the immense crowd; then they tore off sheets
of the corrugated iron of which the building was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
constructed, so that they could get at the contents
more quickly. At one door a big woman stood
guard with an umbrella, beating back any of the
blacks who attempted to enter, but admitting any
white person. She plied her weapon on the heads
of the blacks when they came within reach, and it
was not long before they abandoned the attempt to
go in at that entrance. The looters worked in
squads, a few carrying out the plunder of sugar,
flour, coffee, and other stuffs, while some stood
guard over it until a means of carrying it away was
found. Wheelbarrows, carts, children’s wagons,
and baby carriages were brought into service to take
the provisions to the homes of the people, and for
several hours the streets were alive with hurrying
crowds. Cabs at last could not be hired at any
price, as the cabmen took a hand on their own account
in the general looting.</p>

<p>I was driving past the main warehouse when the
scramble for plunder began, and stopped to watch
the wild scene. In a few moments my driver caught
the fever and asked permission to join the mob,
saying he would be back by the time I needed him.
He carted away enough sugar, flour, coffee, and candles
to last him a year, and came back in such a
happy state of mind that he did not want to accept
any fare for driving me about.</p>

<p>Very few of the burghers of the army took any
hand in the looting, although many of them looked
on and shook their heads in disapproval that so much
of this good store should go to the stay-at-homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
When Lord Roberts occupied the capital and
heard of that day’s work, he sent a large detail out
to search for the plunder, and recovered a considerable
amount, which he turned over to the use of his
army.</p>

<p>For some time it appeared as though there might
be serious trouble, and that the looting would be
extended to shops and banks. Nearly all of these
barricaded their doors and windows and placed a
guard inside. A plot was hatched to break into the
Union Bank, which was known to be British in sentiment;
consequently all the bank officials spent
several days and nights inside the building, armed
with rifles, to protect the property. The attack was
not made, however, probably because the fact of
the guarding of the bank was known.</p>

<p>During all this time the burghers were retreating
towards Middleburg, and by the first of June there
were not half a dozen of the army left in the capital.
Each day the British were expected to march
in, but they did not come; and each day the situation
became more serious, until finally a committee,
appointed by a proclamation issued by General
Botha, formed a special police corps for the protection
of property until the British forces should arrive
and take possession. The corps was composed of
all the foreign consuls and their <i>attachés</i>, and such
men as were not directly in the army. At the
request of Mr. Hay I was sworn in and received a
white band for my arm, on which was stenciled
“P. C. No. 161,” and a pasteboard card imparting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
information to all lawless persons that I was authorized
to take them to jail. But an officer without
the backing of the majesty of the law is not impressive,
and in my one official act I have not yet decided
who came out ahead—only the other fellow didn’t
get the horse.</p>

<p>When the retreating burghers began to straggle
through Pretoria towards the north, they commandeered
any horses that seemed better than the ones
they were riding. Cab horses and carriage horses
were outspanned on the street, and the vehicles and
harnesses left lying on the ground. Stables were
entered and the best of the stock was taken for remounts.
As a war proceeding this was perfectly
legitimate, although it was rather hard on those who
lost their horses. The American consul drove a fine
pair of large Kentucky animals, which were probably
the finest horses in the town, and he had considerable
difficulty in keeping them. Several times the
burghers began to unharness them, but a word telling
them to whom they belonged stopped these
orderly robbers in their attempt. When it became
known that many unscrupulous persons were taking
dishonest advantage of the fact that the commands
were taking remounts and state horses under the
name of the government, an order was issued against
commandeering horses for any purpose.</p>

<p>After this state of unrest and terror had continued
for three or four days without an appearance of the
British, the excitement wore off, confidence was
restored, and many of the burghers of General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Botha’s command who had retreated now returned
to the city.</p>

<p>The last Sunday before the British came dawned
quiet and peaceful as a New England Sabbath; not
a sign of war was to be seen; the streets were
thronged with men, women, and children on their
way to church to pray for their cause and their dead.
The soldier laid aside his rifle and bandolier for the
day, and not one was to be seen throughout the
crowds which were moving towards their respective
places of worship, while the bells rang summons and
welcome. The day was warm enough for the
women to wear white gowns, which served to make
the many black ones the more noticeable. The
children were stiff and starched in their Sunday
cleanliness, and half the church-going crowd was
composed of these little ones. In many a pew there
was no father or brother, but only a sad-faced
woman in sombre black.</p>

<p>The churches were crowded to the doors, and I
tried two or three places before I finally gained admittance
to the church opposite President Krüger’s
house, where he had himself often occupied the
pulpit. It was a typical country church, such as
may be seen in hundreds of our smaller towns; the
windows were open, and a soft breeze blew gently
through the room. The people entered deeply
into their worship, and the sadness that prevailed
made it appear like a service over the dead who had
fallen in battle. Many families were worshiping
together for the last time, for on the morrow a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
battle was to be fought, and all who were going to
continue the fight were to be separated that night
from their loved ones.</p>

  <div class="caption">Burghers’ horses during battle of Pretoria.</div></div>

<p>There was not one in the whole church who was
not weeping. Near me sat a young girl of about
twenty, who sobbed aloud during the entire service,
as though her heart was broken beyond all comfort;
and I afterwards learned that her father and four
brothers were all dead, and that her one remaining
brother was at St. Helena with Cronje. In the pew
in front of me sat an old grizzled burgher with a
heavy gray beard; he needed no rifle to show that
he had been for months on command, for his face was
burned by wind and sun. His arm was around his
wife, whose head rested on his shoulder. She did
not weep, but at frequent intervals she huddled
closer to him and grasped his arm more firmly, as if
afraid he would leave her. On his other side sat a
little girl, who looked around with big, frightened
eyes, wondering at the scene.</p>

<p>The pastor preached from his heart a sermon of
hope and encouragement, his words being interrupted
by the sound of sobbing. Hardly a man
there but had his arm supporting the woman at his
side, or grasped her hand in his. The text was from
Ezekiel, xxxvii. 3–9:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live?
And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.</p>

<p>Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and
say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold,
I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall
live:</p>

<p>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh
upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you,
and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the
Lord.</p>

<p>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied,
there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
together, bone to his bone.</p>

<p>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up
upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was
no breath in them.</p>

<p>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy,
son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God;
Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these
slain, that they may live.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tender, with infinite pathos, yet manful, and with
a virile faith that seemed to make the impossible
actual, the sermon went on. It was a prophet’s
opportunity, such as comes to but few preachers in
all history, to stand at the final threshold of a
nation’s life, to bid farewell to the men leaving for
the forlorn hope of the last struggle, and to embrace
in one cry of faith both the heartbreak and the resolution
of a people. It was in the Dutch tongue,
but the preacher repeated it to me in English the
next day, and I was the witness of the effect of its
simple eloquence on the people.</p>

<p>When the service was over, there was a solemn
and tearful handshaking before the congregation
scattered for the last time to their homes; the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to buckle on their bandoliers and rifles for the next
day’s battle, the women to pray for the safety of
those brave hearts so dear to them, or to weep
alone with memories of those they had loved and
lost.</p>

</div>

<p class="dc l2"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the fourth of June,
1900, the British troops turned
their guns on Pretoria, after hundreds
of miles of weary marching,
enlivened with only a few fights to
break the monotony of the work. There
was not much defense, as it had been
decided that there should be no opposition
to the enemy’s entrance; but as
many of the burghers had returned
over Sunday, and the panic of a few
days before had vanished, they were
taking away more stores than they had
at first intended. Train-loads of troops
and refugees were leaving Pretoria every hour; therefore
General De la Rey, with a rear guard, was detailed
to obstruct the advance as long as possible, to cover
the retreat that was then being made in an orderly
manner. He had but fifteen or eighteen hundred
men to oppose many thousands, but as he had the
advantage of the positions, and as the English commander
did not know whether the forts were occupied
and armed, he was able to hold off the advance all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
The fighting consisted almost entirely of an artillery
bombardment by the British naval guns until
noon, when the right of the Boer line was heavily
engaged, and the rifle and machine-gun fire became
very fast.</p>

<p>The burghers had but six guns with which to
oppose the advance, and they were small field
pieces that could not be put into action until the
enemy advanced almost within rifle range. A little
before dark the fighting was heavy all along the
line, and then the British became fully convinced
that there would be a determined defense at Pretoria.
They were very much disappointed when
they discovered that the burghers had waived the
defense and had saved themselves for a struggle
under other conditions. All day long two of the
guns shelled one of the forts that had long since
been abandoned, but as it was an advantageous
position from which to witness the fighting, some of
the townspeople had gone up there in the forenoon.
They were seen by the British, and were naturally
mistaken for soldiers, consequently they were subjected
to a harmless shell fire. In the afternoon
the invaders brought a large number of their guns
into action, and the shells flew thick and fast over
our position, occasionally striking and exploding at
the crest under which we were lying. Considering
the number of shells, however, very little damage
was done.</p>

  <div class="caption">General De la Rey and a group of his burghers

<p>All through the day the two wings of Lord Roberts’s
army kept extending farther around the town,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and just before dark the retreat from the defenses
began. As the entire force of burghers was compelled
to take one narrow road between the hills,
this was crowded with horsemen, each man trying
to pass the others, although with no great excitement.
There was no talking in the procession; the
men rode along looking like an army of spirits in
the white clouds of dust. Mingled with the horsemen
were men on bicycles, whose clothing showed
that they had taken no part in the campaign; men
on foot, who had come out to witness the fight, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
even men in wagons. Occasionally a gun rumbled
along. All were bent on getting into Pretoria as
soon as possible. Once there, however, they seemed
in no hurry to leave, many remaining until the next
morning, after the British had actually entered the
town.</p>

<p>As I rode into Pretoria there were knots of people
at every gatepost and in every doorway, watching
the retreating burghers, bidding good-by to their
friends, and asking all sorts of questions regarding
the advancing army.</p>

<p>I stopped at the Artillery Barracks, a fine large
brick building, and there saw Major Erasmus, a
member of one of the famous fighting families of
the war; apparently he had not inherited the fighting
spirit, for he had taken off his bandolier, and he
told me that he was going to quit. Around him were
a few more of the same mind, and sitting on a horse
near by was an old burgher talking to them in Dutch.
It needed no knowledge of the language to apprehend
his meaning, for he was evidently speaking
with biting sarcasm, and its effect was plainly seen
in the faces of his hearers. Many others remained
in Pretoria and allowed themselves to be taken,
afterwards taking the oath of neutrality. Only
those who wished to fight it out went on. The faint-hearted
ones who stayed behind were snubbed by
all the women-folk who knew them, and there is no
doubt that many who broke their oath of neutrality
and again took to the field did so in order to
escape the taunts of the patriotic women.</p>

  <div class="caption">British guns captured by the Boers.</div></div>

<p>At the Artillery Barracks were all of the British
guns that had been captured by the Boers, but
which they could not use. None of them was destroyed,
however, and eventually they again fell into
the hands of the English. In a few cases the breech
block was broken, but aside from that they were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
as good condition as on the day they were taken.
It seems strange that the Boers should have allowed
them to go back to the enemy uninjured after the
battling which the possession of them had cost; but
one commandant said that he could not see why
they should uselessly destroy property.</p>

<p>It was said that a couple of English officers with
a few men entered Pretoria that night, but I did
not see them. The first of the enemy that I saw
was an advance body next day, sent in to occupy
the town and to post a guard on all public buildings.
I heard that Lord Roberts and his staff were coming,
and I rode out about a mile to meet them. I then
first beheld that wonderful leader, who is certainly
one of the greatest generals of modern times. His
staff was preceded by an advance bodyguard of
about fifty men; twenty men rode on either side of
the road, flanking his staff by about one hundred
yards. The staff was so large that it looked like a
regiment in itself. At the head I recognized Lord
Roberts, a small man on a large horse, sitting in his
saddle as though pretty well worn out by work. He
was bundled up in a khaki overcoat, as the morning
was very cold. By his side rode Lord Kitchener on
a powerful white horse, the only white one in the
staff. That horse must have been a shining mark
in action, but a little detail of that sort would not
trouble a man of Kitchener’s stamp.</p>

<div id="i_253" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_253.jpg" width="527" height="339" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Lord Roberts and staff approaching Pretoria (Lord Kitchener is on the white
horse, Lord Roberts is the first leading figure at the right).</div></div>

<p>Immediately behind the field marshal and his
chief of staff rode two Indian native servants, familiar
figures in all Lord Roberts’s campaign, for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
never travels without them. It is said that one of
them saved his chief’s life in India, and that he is
now retained in his service forever.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts and his staff rode into the railway
station, where they dismounted and made arrangements
for the formal entry and occupation, which
was to occur that afternoon. The hour set was two
o’clock, but it was twenty minutes past that hour
when the flag was raised. The square had been
cleared long before that by a battalion of the Guards,
and finally the field marshal and his staff rode in
and took a position just opposite the entrance to
the state building. Immediately after his entry
the drums and fifes and a few pieces of brass played
the national anthem, and every one saluted, but no
flag was to be seen at that moment. Finally a murmur
started and circulated throughout the ranks and
the crowd. “There it is!” exclaimed some one.
“Where?” asked another. “On the staff; it’s
up.” “No, that can’t be.” “Yes, it really is.”
And it was.</p>

<p>By looking very carefully we could discern a little
something looking like a stiff, colored table mat at
the top of the high mast, but it was not recognizable
as the Union Jack. It was afterwards learned
that this little flag was made by Lady Roberts,
and that as a matter of sentiment Lord Roberts
had caused it to be raised. But that bit of sentiment
had robbed the occasion of all the patriotic
enthusiasm that would have been awakened by the
sight of a big, magnificent banner. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
a fifteen-foot Union Jack was hoisted, and the men
who operated the moving-picture apparatus waited
until the second day before taking the pictures of
the raising of the British flag over the Transvaal
which were to be shown in the London theatres.</p>

<div id="i_255" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.125em;">

  <div class="caption flush">Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener with staff entering
Pretoria at the railway station, June 5, 1900. The two
locomotives on the right, with Boer engineers, were

to the Boer lines.</div></div>

<p>I was reminded of General Shafter’s anxiety at
Santiago on the morning of July 17th, when he sent
from one end of his army corps to another to find a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
flag large enough to raise over the palace, and of
how pleased he was when one sufficiently large was
finally found. He said that day that the affair
would not be a success unless the flag was large
enough to show that it was waving.</p>

<p>When the British troops entered Pretoria, their
first thought was for their unfortunate brother officers
who were imprisoned there, and their first questions
were regarding them, as they feared they had
been removed by the Boers. While the preparations
were being made for the flag-raising, the imprisoned
officers were released, and came down town
for the first time since their arrival. Many happy
greetings were exchanged, some of them showing an
affection betokening relationship. They were almost
the only ones who did any cheering that day, as the
soldiers were too worn out and the townspeople
were too sad.</p>

<p>As soon as the flag was raised the march past was
begun, and thousands of the magnificent-looking
troops passed in review before Lord Roberts. The
British soldiers made a fine show, although they
were evidently pretty well worn out; their horses,
too, were in bad condition. The Colonials and the
Gordon Highlanders were the most attractive part
of the review and made the best showing. The
naval guns were drawn by many spans of oxen, and
looked tremendously business-like. Under ordinary
conditions the spectacle would have been a sight to
fill a spectator with enthusiasm and admiration; but,
somehow, the scene seemed more an occasion of sadness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
awakening admiration and pity for that little
band of men who had marched out into the night
only a few hours before. An American business
man of Pretoria watched the regiments tramp past,
and then remarked, “Well, I think the best way
for the Boers to win out is to come back to-day
and march in review before this army. They
would not need to fight any more, for this whole
lot would die of shame.”</p>

<p>There was not a very large crowd to witness the
occupation, considering the number of people in the
city, for very few of the Boer sympathizers came
out, and in most cases the women went into their
houses, closing the front doors and windows tightly,
and many did not open their houses until they were
forced to come out to attend to their household
marketing. Along the verandas of the Grand Hotel
and in the street in front of the hotel a few ladies
were to be seen, but except for these the crowd was
composed of men, mostly blacks. This conspicuous
absence of the women served to show the bitter feeling
and intense hatred that prevailed among the
people.</p>

<p>The Union Bank, however, a British institution,
swung out two large Union Jacks in honor of the
event.</p>

<p>While the review was passing, a corporal’s guard
brought in two Boer prisoners, who were marched
into the square, awaiting whatever disposition was
to be made of them. One was a man about fifty, the
other a boy about nine years old, in short trousers;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
but the little fellow had a rifle, and was held as a
prisoner of war. As they stood there I could not
but wonder what those British soldiers thought of
such a sight.</p>

<p>While the review was going on, I stood near the
Burgomaster of Pretoria, a man whom I had met
with General Botha and Secretary Reitz. He was
a man who had held the highest municipal office
under the Boer government, but now he was fawning
upon a major of staff, telling him that he had
always hated the Dutch government and everything
connected with it. To gain favor in the eyes of his
new masters, he blackguarded all the men who had
made him what he was. It did not seem possible
that this pitiful personage could be the same man
who a few days before was an official of the Boer
government.</p>

<p>As soon as the review was dismissed, officers and
men began to explore the town and to fill their
pockets with souvenirs. Stamps and coins were
especially sought after, while copies of the extra
<i>Volkstein</i>, issued the night before, with news of
Johannesburg’s fall and of the coming battle, were
sold for five pounds.</p>

<p>Although there was not much chance to get
liquor, the men found what they wanted, but there
was a surprising absence of drunkenness. To my
surprise and admiration, I saw only one drunken
soldier in that entire army after the occupation.</p>

  <div class="caption">Types of the crowd who watched the British entry.</div></div>

<p>During the first few days of the occupation Lord
Roberts started the machinery of his wonderful government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and in a very short time everything was
running smoothly. All stores and storehouses were
put under guard and the contents commandeered
for military use; although, when the stock was the
property of private individuals, a good price was paid
for it. If the burghers had had sufficient presence
of mind or the inclination to destroy all the stores
in Pretoria, the army under Lord Roberts would
have been not only seriously embarrassed, but in
a very critical condition. As it was, a sufficient
quantity of Boer rations was left to keep the British
going until the railroad was opened. In one
building enough forage had been left by the Boers to
keep the stock supplied until more could arrive. A
single match would have prevented this, but one of
the Boer commandants said regarding it, “Oh, it
would be such a wanton destruction of property!”
They preferred to allow it all to fall into the hands
of their enemies than to burn it. If they had destroyed
it the horses would have had practically
nothing to eat, and all operations would necessarily
have been stopped.</p>

<p>A corps of correspondents came in with Roberts’s
army, and they were all very anxious to hear of the
events that had occurred on the Boer side. Mr.
Dinwiddie, of <i>Harper’s Weekly</i>, was one of the
first in Pretoria; he had but recently come over from
the Philippines, where he had been with General
Lawton, but he had seen all the British advance
since Bloemfontein. I had last seen him during
the Cuban campaign. Another veteran of the Santiago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
campaign was Mr. Atkins, of the Manchester
<i>Guardian</i>. The famous war correspondent, Mr. Bennett
Burleigh, was also among the first to arrive.
He is one of the oldest in the profession, and before
he began writing he fought with the Confederacy
during our Civil War. Mr. Barnes and Mr. Jenkins
were two more of the American correspondents,
although they were representing English papers.</p>

<p>Some of the wagons that were used by the correspondents
and the <i>attachés</i> were grotesque affairs.
One of them was a pie-wagon, with a door in the
back; its possessor had cut a hole in the roof and
run a stovepipe out so that he could cook in any
kind of weather. There were a good many grocers’
wagons, but the most common conveyance was the
two-wheeled Cape cart.</p>

<p>As soon as Lord Roberts took possession, he issued
a conciliatory proclamation, telling the burghers
who wished to lay down their arms and take the
oath binding them to neutrality that they would
not be made prisoners of war. A number availed
themselves of this offer, and most of them kept their
promises; but subsequent events made many of
them take up arms again.</p>

<p>The execution of young Cordua for conspiracy did
much to help the Boer cause by reviving fainting
spirits with the spur of new indignation. Everyone
in Pretoria knew that there had been no plot whatever,
and that the rumors of the supposed conspiracy
had been spread by the agents of the British government.
The young man was known to be simple-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>minded,
and therefore was not responsible for his
actions, but his death was a great stimulus to those
fighting for the Boer cause. The proclamation regarding
the burning and destroying of all farms in
the vicinity of a railroad or telegraph line that was
cut also sent many men back into the field and
made many new recruits. No matter how loyal a
feeling a farmer might have towards the English, he
could not prevent some one from coming down from
the hills in the night and blowing up the tracks or
bridges somewhere within ten miles of his home;
but if this happened his house was burned, and
almost invariably the burghers who were thus deprived
of their homesteads went on commando to
stay to the bitter end.</p>

<p>One proclamation was issued compelling every
man and boy to register his presence in Pretoria;
and another, ordering that all firearms of every description
be turned in to the provost marshal; this
included sporting rifles, shotguns, gallery rifles, and,
in fact, every arm that called for powder. It was
not permitted to any one to ride or drive a horse,
or ride a bicycle, without having obtained a special
permit. Most of these orders were quite necessary
and did no one any great harm. At times the restriction
was troublesome, but that was all; and, upon
the whole, considering the fact that the town was under
military rule, the British government was lenient.</p>

<p>The women of Pretoria were intensely bitter
against the British, and did not scruple to show it.
For several days not one was seen on the streets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
After a time they came out of their houses, but
very seldom would they have anything to say to the
invaders. They showed the same spirit said to have
been shown by our colonial women towards the
British, the same that the women of the Southern
States showed towards the Northern soldiers, and
the same that the French women felt against the
Germans. In their hearts was bitter hatred, but
politeness and gentle breeding toned their actions
to suavity that was sometimes mistaken for weakness
by a race that has never been noted for its
subtle sense of discrimination.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts invited Mrs. Botha to dinner one
night, soon after the occupation of Pretoria, and
she accepted the invitation. Immediately the rumor
was spread throughout the army, and was construed
by the British to mean that General Botha was going
to surrender at once, and that his wife was going
to influence him to do so. On the contrary, Mrs.
Botha told me that if he did surrender as long as
there was a possible chance to fight, she would never
speak to him again. Her eyes flashed and her manner
was very far from that of a woman who was
weakening because she had dined with the commander-in-chief.
She obviously had her reasons
for doing it, and there is no doubt that General
Botha heard all that went on from herself the next
morning. The system of communication between
the burghers in the field and their families was facile
and well conducted, and the women kept the men
informed of every move of the British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
One afternoon I was riding along the streets of
Pretoria with an English officer, and we passed
General Botha’s little son. I pointed him out to
my companion, who pulled up to talk with him.
He was a boy of seven or eight, bright and good
looking. The officer asked him what he thought of
the British soldiers now that he had seen them.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all right,” he answered evasively.</p>

<p>“Well, from now on you will live under the British
flag,” said the officer, trying to tease him in a
good-natured way.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he replied, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And you will become just as much an Englishman
as any of us, and like it,” continued the officer.</p>

<p>In an instant all the boy’s evasiveness was gone;
his fists clenched and his head came up sharply.</p>

<p>“I never will be English!” he exclaimed vehemently.
“I hate you all! You may make us live
under that flag, but you’ll never make us like it—never!”
And he stamped his foot to emphasize
his tirade against the enemies who had driven his
father away. This is the spirit shown on every side
in the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and even
in Cape Colony itself. The people seem contented
enough until they are stirred, and then their liberty-loving
blood makes them speak their real feeling.</p>

<div id="i_265" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="360" height="279" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Lord Kitchener bidding good-by to the foreign attachés
after the capture of Pretoria.</div></div>

<p>A few days after the occupation a pretty young
woman, tastefully dressed in a white summer gown,
appeared on the street with a large bow of the national
colors, red, white, blue, and green, pinned on
her shoulder. An officer stopped her and told her to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
take it off, but she looked at him contemptuously
and turned away. He stopped her again, and
finally removed the colors himself. The young lady
made no resistance, but passed on. Within half an
hour she was out with another equally large bow of
the colors. Again it was taken away from her, and
again she put on another knot of ribbons. The
matter was brought to the attention of the military
governor, and she was told that if it happened again
she would be put in jail; but it did happen again
just as fast as she could get the ribbon to put on.
Whether she was arrested or not I never knew, but
I saw her on the street several days later still wearing
the colors of her country.</p>

<p>For some days before the British arrived, the
prices in Pretoria for provisions of all kinds had
advanced to unheard-of figures. There seemed to
be a sufficient quantity of everything, except white
flour; but those who had stock on hand were making
the best of their opportunity. The flour seemed
to have been “cornered” by the bakers, for they
were all furnishing bread regularly, and were charging
from fifteen to twenty-five cents a loaf, according
to the size. This was considered very cheap in comparison
with the price asked for a sack of flour a few
days before, the lowest price then being five pounds.
“Mealies,” or common corn, sold at thirty to sixty
shillings unground, the regular price being six or
eight shillings. As this corn was used only to feed
animals it made the expense of keeping a horse
rather high. Up to this time the English have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
discovered the value of Indian corn as a food product,
although many attempts have been made to introduce
it into England. There was an abundance
of canned goods that sold at a fairly reasonable price,
and also plenty of fresh beef, although it was of the
trek-ox variety, and almost impossible to eat.</p>

<p>When the British army entered the capital, with
over forty thousand hungry men, looking for anything
as a change from the regular ration, prices
jumped higher still, and the stocks in the various
stores speedily vanished. One of the first official
acts of the new government was to place a guard
over the various provision stores, allowing no one to
buy without an order from one in authority. This
was done to prevent some of the officers’ messes
from buying up everything in sight.</p>

<p>Fresh vegetables were exceedingly scarce, although
very early in the mornings some came in
from the country, and it was always a case of the
“early bird” as to who was fortunate enough to
get hold of them. Butter was a greater luxury than
champagne, and if any was secured a dinner party
was sure to follow.</p>

<p>“Come up and dine with me to-night; I’ve got
some butter,” was the strongest invitation that
could be issued, and one that was never refused.</p>

<p>Consul Hay kept many men and women from
going hungry, for he had laid in a large stock of
provisions against the expected siege of Pretoria;
consequently he had plenty of food stuffs to spare,
and any one who was known to be needy was welcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
to a share. He also stabled several horses
for their owners when there was absolutely no forage
to be bought at any price.</p>

<p>When prices had reached an impossible mark,
Lord Roberts took the matter in hand and issued a
proclamation giving a list of all necessary articles
and the legal prices to be charged for them, and
any one asking more was liable to severe punishment.
Some found a way to evade the order by
giving short weight; but a few days later the first
supply train came in from the southern base of supplies,
and then prices resumed their natural scale.</p>

<p>It was an irremediable military blunder for the
retreating burghers not to destroy all supplies and
forage in Pretoria. Even as it was, Lord Roberts
had made three attempts to advance his main force,
and each time was compelled to retire, not because
of the force of the Boers opposing him, but because
of his inability to get rations up to his troops.</p>

<p>It was not a glorious entry, and the occupation
was not so satisfactory to the British themselves
that the word “Pretoria” on the regimental standards
will stir a soldier’s throb for many years to
come. Some day the blunders will be forgotten, the
human wrongs will grow dim in distance, and only
the glory of effort and the benefit to civilization
will be thought of; but not until then will the
British be proud of their conquest.</p>

<p>The burghers in this the first city of their fair
land are conscientious and honest; they know they
have the right on their side, and they are willing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
pray and die for it. The English do not understand
these plain folk as we would, for we have the same
sort of men and women. Instead of trying to understand
them, the English are prone to ridicule them.</p>

<p>Their devotion to the faith in which they believe
has been a special target for this ridicule, although
I never saw the time when they made that devotion
obnoxious to even the lowest unbeliever. They
worship in their own way, believe in their own creed,
which is very like that of the great majority of the
people of the United States. When I listened to
the Dutch pastor preach that last sermon before the
British entered Pretoria, I heard nothing that could
offend any one; and yet, less than two weeks later,
at my own table, in the presence of half a dozen
British officers, an English chaplain told us as a
great joke, over his brandy and soda, that he had
heard of a sermon that was preached exhorting
the Boers to fight, and that he had informed the
provost marshal and had the Dutch pastor thrown
into jail. After a moment’s pause he added, “I
occupied his pulpit myself last Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said one of the British officers, “that is
a method of getting a pulpit that I never heard of
before.”</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
